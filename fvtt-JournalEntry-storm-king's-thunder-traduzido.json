Você pode começar a aventura com personagens de 1º nível ou 5º nível. De qualquer forma, os personagens devem alcançar pelo menos o 11º nível até a conclusão da aventura. Como os gigantes figuram proeminentemente na história, pelo menos um personagem deve ser capaz de falar e entender a linguagem Gigante.</p><p>A aventura acontece nos Reinos Esquecidos, especificamente em uma região conhecida como Fronteira Selvagem, no canto noroeste do continente de Faerûn. No entanto, você pode facilmente adaptar a aventura para sua campanha doméstica mudando os nomes de várias localizações e facções.</p><p>Recomendamos que você leia toda a aventura antes de tentar executá-la. Esta introdução começa com uma seção \"@UUID[.0000000000000000#adventure-background]{Antecedentes da Aventura}\" que resume os eventos que colocam a aventura em movimento. A seção \"@UUID[.0000000000000000#running-the-adventure]{Executando a Aventura}\" diz tudo o que você precisa saber para executar a aventura suavemente. Essa seção também apresenta diretrizes para o avanço de nível dos personagens, delineia o fluxo da aventura e descreve seus principais desafios. Uma vez que você tenha revisado este material e esteja pronto para executar a aventura, prossiga com o capítulo 1, \"@UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001]{Uma Grande Convulsão},\" se os personagens estão começando no 1º nível, ou capítulo 2, \"@UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{Rumores},\" se eles estão começando no 5º nível.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Adventure Background\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Antecedentes da Aventura</span></h1> <p>A Fronteira Selvagem (também conhecida como o Norte) é uma terra fria, acidentada e pouco povoada de montanhas cobertas de neve, colinas rochosas, florestas extensas e vales nebulosos. Fortalezas isoladas, antigos montes funerários e as ruínas de muitos impérios esquecidos pontilham esta vasta paisagem. Limitada pelo Mar das Espadas a oeste e pelo deserto de Anauroch a leste, a Fronteira Selvagem se estende até o norte até o Vale do Vento Gelado e até o sul até a cidade de Daggerford. Estradas antigas se estendem por esta grande extensão, ligando as fortalezas e minas anãs nas montanhas aos assentamentos costeiros, cidades fronteiriças e postos avançados fortificados de humanos e outros povos. Essas estradas são longas, solitárias ou mal defendidas, tornando-as perigosas de atravessar. Em vales férteis, cidades e vilas surgiram, separadas por dezenas, senão centenas de milhas de natureza selvagem indomada assombrada por bandidos, bárbaros e monstros.</p><p>Dragões malignos incitados à ação por sua rainha sombria, Tiamat, ameaçaram os assentamentos da Fronteira Selvagem por um tempo. Finalmente, eles foram derrotados e forçados a se retirar para seus covis, enquanto Tiamat foi banida para os Nove Infernos. O medo da ira dos dragões desvaneceu rapidamente com a chegada de uma nova ameaça: gigantes. Os povos do Norte não são estranhos às incursões de gigantes. Gigantes do gelo há muito reivindicaram a Espinha do Mundo como seu domínio, e gigantes das colinas são conhecidos por vasculhar por comida nas colinas indomadas. Mas agora, nos últimos dois meses, gigantes de todo tipo emergiram de suas fortalezas em força para ameaçar a civilização como nunca antes—e não apenas gigantes do gelo e gigantes das colinas, mas também gigantes de pedra, gigantes do fogo e gigantes das nuvens. Todos os gigantes estão em alvoroço. Relatórios de ataques de gigantes por todo o Norte chegaram às cidades costeiras de Luskan, Neverwinter e Waterdeep, alimentando temores de que os gigantes estão travando guerra contra humanos, anões, elfos e outros povos pequenos.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"The Ordning\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Ordenação</span></h2> <p>A sociedade gigante (tal como é) é definida em grande parte pela ordenação, um sistema de castas imposto aos gigantes por seus deuses, principalmente Annam, o Todo-Pai. A ordenação determina onde um gigante se posiciona entre seus semelhantes. Tradicionalmente, os gigantes das tempestades ficaram no topo da ordenação. Altos e poderosos, eles lutam para impedir que as raças mais fracas de gigantes despojem os reinos dos povos pequenos e provoquem conflitos. Os maiores gigantes das tempestades são videntes poderosos, hábeis em identificar e interpretar sinais cósmicos e presságios divinos. Os gigantes das nuvens altivos e aristocráticos, um degrau abaixo dos gigantes das tempestades, raramente se dignam a lidar com gigantes menores ou povos pequenos. A extravagância define sua cultura e seu lugar na ordenação. Abaixo deles estão os gigantes do fogo tirânicos e belicosos e os gigantes do gelo impiedosos e predatórios. Os gigantes do fogo se classificam por sua habilidade de forja, enquanto os gigantes do gelo se classificam por sua proeza marcial. Perto do fundo da ordenação estão os gigantes de pedra xenófobos, que vivem principalmente no subsolo e consideram o mundo da superfície como um reino de sonhos. Quão bem eles esculpem pedra determina seu lugar entre seus pares. Os menores e mais baixos dos verdadeiros gigantes são os gigantes das colinas, tão glutões quanto repugnantes. Os gigantes das colinas são estúpidos que vivem com medo de seus primos gigantes mais poderosos. Na sociedade dos gigantes das colinas, o maior governa.</p><p>Os dragões são os antigos inimigos dos gigantes. Milhares de anos atrás, o último grande império dos gigantes—Ostoria—caiu após um longo e brutal conflito com dragões. Pouco de Ostoria permanece no que agora é chamado de Fronteira Selvagem. As civilizações dos povos pequenos tomaram conta da terra uma vez governada por gigantes. Embora gigantes malignos façam incursões ocasionais em território colonizado por povos pequenos, suas ambições há muito foram restringidas por sua falta de coesão e a imposição de gigantes das tempestades e gigantes das nuvens de alinhamento bondoso cujas memórias da antiga e gloriosa Ostoria desvaneceram ao longo do tempo.</p><p>Os esforços recentes dos dragões para trazer Tiamat ao mundo (como contado nas aventuras<i>Tesouro da Rainha Dragão</i>e<i>A Ascensão de Tiamat</i>) e as tentativas dos povos pequenos de frustrá-los perturbaram tanto os deuses gigantes que Annam, o Todo-Pai, despedaçou a ordenação entre os gigantes para tirar seus \"filhos\" de sua complacência, colocando os seis tipos de gigantes uns contra os outros enquanto mantinha alguma aparência de ordem dentro de cada tipo. Ao fazer isso, Annam estimulou gigantes das nuvens, do fogo, do gelo, de pedra e das colinas a desafiar a hierarquia estabelecida e reforjar seu destino. Todos os gigantes sentiram a convulsão instantaneamente, e agora os tipos de gigantes competem ferozmente uns contra os outros, esforçando-se para criar uma nova ordenação através de seus feitos e realizações. Esses empreendimentos calamitosos dos gigantes não apenas colocaram os assentamentos de humanos e outros povos pequenos em perigo, mas também atraíram a atenção dos antigos inimigos dos gigantes—os dragões—que não tolerarão a ascensão de outro império gigante.</p><p>Os povos pequenos só podem especular sobre a causa da agitação dos gigantes. Resta saber se a antiga ordenação entre os tipos de gigantes será restaurada, ou se uma nova hierarquia substituirá a antiga, derrubando os gigantes das tempestades de seu poleiro elevado.</p><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/000-giantrunes.webp\"/>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"King Hekaton and His Daughters\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rei Hekaton e Suas Filhas</span></h2> <p>Antes do despedaçamento da ordenação, @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{Rei Hekaton} era indiscutivelmente o mais poderoso de todos os gigantes das tempestades. De Maelstrom, sua cidadela nas profundezas do Mar Sem Trilhas, ele presidia uma corte que incluía representantes de todas as raças de gigantes, desde poderosos gigantes das tempestades até humildes gigantes das colinas. Ele usava o poder do @UUID[Item.MSfT5T7iBD5Bey69]{Trono Crânio de Dragão}—um presente dado a ele por sua esposa—para manter os gigantes mais indisciplinados na linha.</p><p>Por tanto tempo quanto Hekaton havia reinado, o medo da ira do rei e o respeito pela ordenação eram suficientes para impedir que gigantes menores se levantassem contra ele. Mas nos últimos anos, @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{Rei Hekaton} havia se convencido de que a era dos gigantes havia passado, como evidenciado pela crescente distância entre os gigantes e seus deuses. Annam, o Todo-Pai, não respondia às orações, e sua prole divina—os deuses gigantes menores—estavam fora de contato, constantemente travando guerra uns contra os outros nos Planos Exteriores. Hekaton passou a acreditar que os gigantes não eram mais os mestres legítimos do mundo.</p><p>Então, vários meses atrás, o medo de Hekaton se tornou realidade quando a ordenação foi despedaçada. O rei ficou profundamente abalado pela percepção de que os gigantes das tempestades poderiam perder seu status de ápice entre os gigantes. No rescaldo da convulsão, ele fez o máximo para manter sua corte unida, intimidando gigantes mais fracos à submissão.</p><p>A esposa de Hekaton, Rainha Neri, tinha particular afeição pelos povos pequenos. Ela os visitava frequentemente nos anos antes da ordenação ser despedaçada, emergindo do mar para encontrá-los nas costas da Costa da Espada. Neri continuamente instava seu marido a respeitar as civilizações dos povos pequenos e deixá-los em paz, se ele não pudesse tolerar formar alianças com eles. Hekaton, inerentemente desconfiado dos povos pequenos, não queria nada com eles, mas respeitava o desejo de sua esposa de tratá-los ocasionalmente.</p><p>Neri continuou a visitar os povos pequenos de tempos em tempos mesmo após a convulsão—até que chegou o dia em que ela falhou em retornar de uma de suas viagens à Costa da Espada. O irmão mais novo de Hekaton, @UUID[Actor.ZJQLAPDcsc4lQGnr]{Imperador Uthor}, comandante da guarnição do rei, encontrou o cadáver de Neri pouco depois em uma pequena ilha onde ela era conhecida por se encontrar com humanos. Estava claro que ela havia sido morta por povos pequenos, e Hekaton chorou por dias antes de ameaçar desencadear sua vingança nos territórios costeiros desavisados.</p><p>Uthor não conseguiu acalmar a raiva de seu irmão, então ele se voltou para @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Princesa Serissa}, a filha mais nova do rei, em busca de ajuda. @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa}, que compartilhava a afeição de sua mãe pelos povos pequenos e que estava próxima na linha para herdar o @UUID[Item.MSfT5T7iBD5Bey69]{Trono Crânio de Dragão}, instou seu pai a descobrir a verdade antes de atacar qualquer um que encontrasse. Hekaton foi influenciado pela sensatez e sabedoria de sua filha, e uma vez que sua raiva semelhante a um furacão seguiu seu curso, ele partiu para aprender como sua esposa encontrou seu fim. Infelizmente para o rei, ele estava cego para inimigos não apenas em sua corte, mas também em sua família.</p><p>As sementes do descontentamento na família de Hekaton foram plantadas mais de um ano antes da ordenação ser despedaçada, quando o rei adivinhou que suas duas filhas mais velhas, @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} e @UUID[Actor.89WgkGAR6oRqRhC0]{Nym}, eram inadequadas para governar, e viu sinais que apontavam para @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa}, sua filha mais nova, como sua sucessora mais digna. @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} era tempestuosa e propensa a explosões emocionais, enquanto @UUID[Actor.89WgkGAR6oRqRhC0]{Nym} era o oposto—tão fria e sem amor quanto o mar. Embora Hekaton adorasse ambas, ele duvidava de sua capacidade de manter os gigantes menores na linha, então ele nomeou @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} como sua herdeira aparente.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} e @UUID[Actor.89WgkGAR6oRqRhC0]{Nym} acataram sua decisão, mas mesmo assim sua infelicidade era clara. Secretamente, elas culpavam sua mãe por persuadir seu pai a passá-las para trás. Sua culpa era infundada, na verdade; a Rainha Neri havia realmente alertado seu marido contra fazer tal pronunciamento. @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} e @UUID[Actor.89WgkGAR6oRqRhC0]{Nym} ferviam por dentro, mas estavam muito aterrorizadas com seu pai para fazer qualquer coisa, até que uma chegada recente a Maelstrom chamada @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} se infiltrou na corte de Hekaton e as provocou à ação.</p><p>As irmãs mais velhas, agindo de acordo com o conselho de @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}, são responsáveis tanto pela morte de Neri quanto pelo desaparecimento de Hekaton. @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} e @UUID[Actor.89WgkGAR6oRqRhC0]{Nym} obtiveram sua vingança contra Neri tramando—com a ajuda de @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}—para tê-la assassinada. Então elas instaram seu pai a caçar os povos pequenos que mataram sua mãe e o alimentaram com informações falsas sobre o paradeiro dos assassinos, para tirar o rei do caminho e colocá-lo em perigo.</p><p>No rescaldo do desaparecimento de Hekaton, a turbulência engolfou sua corte. Após quase um mês esperando ele voltar, @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} relutantemente reivindicou o trono de seu pai por insistência de @UUID[Actor.ZJQLAPDcsc4lQGnr]{Imperador Uthor}.</p><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/001-hekatonanddaughters.webp\"/>\n</div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Mirran and Nym\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"5\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mirran e Nym</span></h3> <p>A filha mais velha de @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{Rei Hekaton}, @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran}, é uma mimada com a força e imprevisibilidade de um tufão. Ela cobiça o poder do @UUID[Item.MSfT5T7iBD5Bey69]{Trono Crânio de Dragão} e acredita que ele pertence legitimamente a ela. Ela está zangada com seus pais por colocar @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} próxima na linha de sucessão, e ela deixou seus sentimentos claros. @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} acredita que está destinada a governar e viu sinais que reforçam sua crença. Uma vez que ela reivindique o trono, @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} espera que todos os outros gigantes se ajoelhem diante dela. Ela planeja usar seu novo poder para ressuscitar o antigo império de Ostoria, varrendo as cidades e reinos dos povos pequenos.</p><p>Se @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} é o vendaval tempestuoso de uma tempestade oceânica, então @UUID[Actor.89WgkGAR6oRqRhC0]{Nym} é a correnteza subterrânea. A filha do meio de @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{Rei Hekaton} é fria e calculista. Ela sempre se sentiu negligenciada por seus pais, em parte porque @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} era tão exigente e @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} tão jovem. Na verdade, @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{Rei Hekaton} e a Rainha Neri amavam @UUID[Actor.89WgkGAR6oRqRhC0]{Nym} tanto quanto adoravam suas outras filhas, mas a achavam distante e difícil de agradar. @UUID[Actor.89WgkGAR6oRqRhC0]{Nym} quer que @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} tome o trono—e então, quando @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} fizer inimigos a cada passo e provar a todos que ela é inadequada para governar, @UUID[Actor.89WgkGAR6oRqRhC0]{Nym} planeja suplantá-la. Ela recebeu presságios que apoiam sua busca pelo poder. Ao contrário de sua irmã mais velha tempestuosa, @UUID[Actor.89WgkGAR6oRqRhC0]{Nym} está preocupada com as consequências da dissolução da ordenação. No entanto, @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} a convenceu de que ela tem um destino importante a cumprir, e que os deuses a recompensarão se ela trouxer de volta o retorno de Ostoria.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Serissa\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"6\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Serissa</span></h3> <p>Quando @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{Rei Hekaton} desaparece, @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Princesa Serissa} se vê empurrada ao poder. Incapaz de encontrar seu pai e temendo que ele possa estar morto, @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} pode imaginar sua influência política evaporando rapidamente. Vários senhores gigantes anteriormente sob o polegar de seu pai abandonaram sua corte e partiram para impressionar os deuses de maneiras que poderiam quase destruir as civilizações dos povos pequenos. @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} teme a guerra entre as seis raças gigantes enquanto elas se esforçam para superar umas às outras, talvez no processo reacendendo o antigo conflito entre gigantes e dragões. A princesa-regente sabe que suas irmãs mais velhas a invejam e desprezam, mas nunca lhe ocorreu que elas estivessem envolvidas na morte de sua mãe ou no sequestro de seu pai. Além de @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} e seu Tio Uthor, há poucos gigantes em quem @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} sente que pode confiar.</p><p>Hekaton left behind a piece of regalia called the @UUID[Item.wxxtNZfbSofBDAK3]{Korolnor Scepter}, a magic item that allows its owner to harness the powers of the @UUID[Item.MSfT5T7iBD5Bey69]{Wyrmskull Throne}. In accordance with her father's wishes, @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} has claimed the scepter and the throne. Even with the throne's magic at her command, she feels adrift. @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} wants to reach out to the small folk for help in finding her father, because she knows that despite their size, they are capable of great feats of heroism. But @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} and Uthor have advised @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} to steer clear of them. Uthor believes (incorrectly) that an alliance with the small folk would further anger Annam the All-Father, while @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} wants the giants and the small folk to annihilate one another.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} values the counsel of her advisors, but she has her own mind. She wants to see her faith—and her mother's faith—in the small folk vindicated, so she leaps at any opportunity to use small folk to find her father, who she believes has the power to set things right. She is hoping for a cosmic sign to validate her beliefs, but time is not on her side.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Iymrith\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Iymrith</span></h2> <p>@UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} is an ancient blue dragon who can assume the form of a storm giant. In this guise, she has infiltrated Hekaton's court. While concealing her true nature and agenda from the giants, @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} offers counsel to @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Princess Serissa} and at the same time secretly feeds the anger and jealousy of @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa}'s older siblings, with the ultimate goal of thrusting the giants into war with the small folk. The dragon also wants to wrest the @UUID[Item.MSfT5T7iBD5Bey69]{Wyrmskull Throne} from the storm giants and add it to her trove.</p><p>The disguised dragon put @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} and @UUID[Actor.89WgkGAR6oRqRhC0]{Nym} in contact with representatives of @UUID[Actor.hzFTNht0gQVKiZaT]{Slarkrethel}, a legendary kraken that haunts the Trackless Sea. These small folk belong to a secret yet widespread organization called the Kraken Society. Using information given to them by the evil storm giant sisters, Kraken Society operatives ambushed and killed Queen Neri. @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} then planted rumors in the storm giant court that the queen had been assassinated by the Lords' Alliance, a confederacy of cities and settlements populated by small folk and scattered throughout the North. The Lords' Alliance represents one of the greatest threats to dragons in Faerûn, so @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} is keen to bring about its end.</p><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/002-giants1.webp\"/>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"The Giant Lords\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"8\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Giant Lords</span></h2> <p>Convinced that @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} is dead or otherwise out of the picture, five giant lords have struck out into the world to reshape the ordning through their deeds, each hoping to be elevated by the gods to the pinnacle of giantkind.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Chief Guh\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"9\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chief Guh</span></h3> <p>Guh, a gluttonous hill giant chief, has raised an enormous timber steading in the hills northeast of Goldenfields, in the central Dessarin Valley. Comfortably housed within her lair, Guh has instructed her husbands to bring her all the food they can carry. Her plan is to consume all that is brought before her and grow to immense size. When she becomes the largest giant in the world, Guh believes the gods will reward her and elevate hill giants to the top of the ordning. Guh has spent the past four months gorging herself, while nearby ranches, farmsteads, and orchards have been pillaged. Not content with the amount of food hoarded thus far, Guh's mates move to attack nearby settlements and plunder their fields and storehouses.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Thane Kayalithica\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"10\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Thane Kayalithica</span></h3> <p>After fleeing Hekaton's court, Kayalithica, an inscrutable stone giant thane, withdrew to her canyon sanctuary of Deadstone Cleft. There, in its hallowed halls, she hoped to elevate her people to the top of the ordning by first seeking divine inspiration. Deadstone Cleft is hidden within the Graypeak Mountains, east of Delimbiyr Vale and the High Forest, and northeast of the mining settlement of Llorkh. After weeks of meditation, Kayalithica concluded that the small folk had corrupted the dreams of all giants by building their wretched settlements on the bones of ancient Ostoria. She intends to wipe the land clean of their \"filth,\" thus restoring the \"dream world\" to its rightful state. Kayalithica's stone giants strike forth from Deadstone Cleft to destroy the works of humans, dwarves, and elves, then return to carve the tales of their accomplishments into the walls for the gods to see and admire.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Jarl Storvald\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"11\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Jarl Storvald</span></h3> <p>Storvald, a fierce and adventurous frost giant jarl, traveled to the coldest reaches of the Sea of Moving Ice to reclaim Svardborg, the ancestral home of his forebears. He found a nest of white dragon eggs within the iceberg fortress and successfully enslaved a mated pair of white dragons by holding their eggs hostage. Within a matter of months thereafter, he also freed several gigantic longships from the ice and sent his giant raiders out to attack smaller ships and plunder their supplies, as well as to pillage wood from the mainland to repair the damaged ships and lodges of Svardborg.</p><p>Storvald has childhood memories of a legend about the Ice That Never Melts—a powerful, frost-coated golden ring that can freeze the oceans and blanket the world in mountains of snow. Small folk know this artifact by another name: the <i>Ring of Winter</i>. The ring, which grants immortality to its wearer, was last seen in the possession of a human adventurer (and former Harper) named Artus Cimber. Guided by magical runes of tracking, Storvald plans to find the ring and bring about the Age of Everlasting Ice, thus ensuring his place at the top of the ordning. Storvald procured a drop of Cimber's blood from a Zhentarim wizard named Nilraun, and used the drop to empower his runes. Unbeknown to Storvald, the runes are steering the frost giants not to Artus Cimber but to other, closer individuals who carry the Cimber bloodline—Artus's living relatives, most of whom know nothing about the <i>Ring of Winter</i>'s whereabouts.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Duke Zalto\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"12\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Duke Zalto</span></h3> <p>Zalto, a fire giant duke, believes that he can become the ruler of all giants by slaughtering their ancient enemies: dragons. @UUID[Actor.dEAfcnl04rCFkRQm]{Duke Zalto} has set his minions to the task of finding and unearthing fragments of a dragon-slaying colossus called the Vonindod (\"titan of death\"). Pieces of it were lost in battle, while the rest was dismantled at the end of the ancient war between giants and dragonkind. Once all the pieces are found, Zalto plans to reforge the Vonindod and unleash it on the world. Beneath the Ice Spires lies an ancient fire giant forge called Ironslag. Unfortunately for Zalto, Ironslag's forges aren't hot enough to repair the colossus. The duke, undaunted, plans to steal Maegera, the fire primordial trapped in the subterranean dwarven fortress-city of Gauntlgrym, and trap it within Ironslag's adamantine forge. The dwarves rely on Maegera to heat their own forges. Hesitant to storm the dwarven fortress, Zalto has met with drow representatives of House Xorlarrin, who know the layout of Gauntlgrym well.

Like archaeologists, they seek to uncover secrets of the past and retrieve relics of their ancient history to impress the gods. Sansuri, a powerful wizard, is searching for something more: a long-lost trove of dragon magic, hidden away by her ancestors. Once cloud giants knock storm giants from the pinnacle of the ordning, she plans to use her newfound magic to destroy her rivals as well as Hekaton's court. But the countess is not happy at present, because her search for the lost trove has not been going well. Frustrated, Sansuri has used powerful magic and guile to capture a bronze dragon named @UUID[Actor.70ymlDsplvkkfQM4]{Felgolos}. She is torturing the wyrm for information.

Various organizations throughout the North are justly concerned, and some have important roles to play in events yet to unfold.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"The Harpers\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"15\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Harpers</span></h3> <p>The Harpers are spellcasters and spies who covertly oppose the abuse of power, magical or otherwise. Working alone or in small cells, they gather information throughout Faerûn, discern the political dynamics within each region, and help the weak, the poor, and the oppressed, acting openly only as a last resort.</p><p>The Harpers were instrumental in defeating Tiamat and ending the tyranny of dragons, and with reports of giant attacks on the rise, they see giants as an emergent threat to peace in the North. The Harpers don't know why the giants are becoming so active all at once, or what their ultimate goals are. As yet, no major towns or cities have come under attack, although the Harpers expect that situation to change. Harpers are eager to recruit adventurers to help them combat the giant threat.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"The Lords' Alliance\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"16\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Lords' Alliance</span></h3> <p>Various settlements of the North have banded together to form the Lords' Alliance, a shaky coalition that proactively eliminates threats to their mutual safety and prosperity. Alliance leaders are often contentious, while their operatives seek honor and glory for themselves and their respective lords. Key representatives of the Lords' Alliance include the canny Lord Dagult Neverember of Neverwinter, the resplendent Lady Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep, the grave Lord Taern Hornblade of Silverymoon, and the willful Queen Dagnabbet of Mithral Hall.</p><p>With the aid of adventurers, the Lords' Alliance thwarted Tiamat and her dragons. Alliance members aren't about to let giants run roughshod over their settlements and plunder their farmsteads. Alliance members call on adventurers of every stripe to attack and kill giants on sight, promising rewards of 200 to 500 gold pieces for each giant head brought to their gates.</p><p>Rumors that the Lords' Alliance was behind @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton}'s disappearance have not yet reached the alliance leaders. Were the alliance to learn of these rumors, its leaders would quietly investigate the veracity of the claims while publicly dismissing them.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Creating New Giant Lords\"><h4 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"17\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating New Giant Lords</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span title=\"Page 12\">p12</span></span></span></h4> <p>This adventure focuses on the machinations of a few giant lords, but they aren't the only evil giants vying for glory and their gods' admiration.

They struggle to keep civilization and the wilderness from destroying each other, and they help others survive the natural perils of the Savage Frontier.</p><p>As sightings of giants become more common, members of the Emerald Enclave begin to realize something is afoot. Hill giants laying waste to vast tracts of forest, stone giants leveling homesteads, frost giants endangering mountain passes, and fire giants rounding up slaves and putting grasslands and forests to the torch are enough to invoke the enclave's wrath.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"The Order of the Gauntlet\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"19\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Order of the Gauntlet</span></h3> <p>Members of the Order of the Gauntlet seek to protect others from the depredations of evildoers.

Adventurers allied with the Zhentarim are free to profit as they see fit, either by helping or hindering the giants.</p><p>The Black Network has spies and operatives in every major northern settlement, and it doesn't wish to see its footholds destroyed by rampaging giants. As it strives to protect its holdings, the Zhentarim also wants to understand the giants' motivations. The leaders of the Black Network are open to the possibility of establishing trade relations with the giants or bribing them, if necessary, to ensure their own continued wealth and prosperity. At the same time, the Zhentarim profits by selling the services of mercenaries to those who can't defend themselves.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"The Kraken Society\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"21\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Kraken Society</span></h3> <p>Far from being a benevolent faction, the Kraken Society is a group of spies, smugglers, slavers, and assassins.

In the meantime, its stretches its tentacles across Faerûn, laying low powers that might one day threaten it.</p><p>Worship of @UUID[Actor.hzFTNht0gQVKiZaT]{Slarkrethel} began hundreds of years ago on the Purple Rocks.

These sacrificed offspring resurface and return to their villages years later as adults, albeit with piscine deformities. When they reach the end of their natural life span, they return to the sea and their fearsome master. The inhabitants of the Purple Rocks otherwise eke out quiet lives, unaware of the kraken's vast spy network on the mainland.</p><p>The Kraken Society's widespread organization wasn't born at the Purple Rocks, but in the cities of the North. The psychic abilities of the kraken are so great that it can reach out to creatures on land up and down the Sword Coast. Over the years, it has telepathically lured exiles, outcasts, and lost souls to its organization with the promise of a better life. Its agents are evil and grasping. When they are not gathering information for the kraken, they lurk in the shadows and indulge in activities befitting their evil nature.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.hzFTNht0gQVKiZaT]{Slarkrethel} was old when the giants and dragons waged war against each other forty thousand years ago, and the kraken aims to rekindle that war and destroy the cities of the Sword Coast in the process.

It also shows the level for which each chapter is designed.</p><p>The adventure begins with @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001]{chapter 1}. The adventurers arrive at the fortified village of Nightstone, shortly after a cloud giant attack. After securing the settlement, the characters locate several missing villagers in a monster-infested cave complex north of the village. The chapter concludes with the characters rescuing the villagers and gaining a quest that leads them to one of three locations: Bryn Shander, Goldenfields, or Triboar. @UUID[Actor.OvAB5zfTByRnBG48]{Zephyros}, a friendly cloud giant wizard, offers to transport them to their destination with the aid of his flying tower. En route, the characters fend off a group of evil air cultists as well as a Lords' Alliance strike team that mistakes @UUID[Actor.OvAB5zfTByRnBG48]{Zephyros} for a hostile threat. After delivering the characters to their intended destination, @UUID[Actor.OvAB5zfTByRnBG48]{Zephyros} bids the party farewell before taking his leave.</p><p>In @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 2}, the characters defend Bryn Shander, Goldenfields, or Triboar against a giant attack. Quests gained at the end of the battle prompt them to explore more of the Savage Frontier. The characters eventually cross paths with another friendly giant: a frost giant adventurer named @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag}. These events are described in @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003]{chapter 3}.</p><p>In @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004]{chapter 4}, @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} leads the characters to a temple under the Spine of the World, wherein they consult a divine oracle. The oracle requires that the adventurers retrieve some lost relics buried under Uthgardt ancestral mounds scattered throughout the North. If the adventurers complete the oracle's quest, it tells them what must be done to end the giant threat. As the characters leave the temple for the last time, @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} appears and attacks them. @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} holds the ancient blue dragon at bay while the adventurers escape with or without the aid of mysterious dragon cultists and an airship.</p><p>Chapters 5 through 9 describe the lairs of five giant lords threatening the North. Players choose which giant lord they wish to confront. This villain has a @UUID[Item.zDgKqy8YpOBW8a8o]{conch of teleportation} that the characters need to reach Maelstrom, a storm giant stronghold in the depths of the Trackless Sea. @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000011]{Chapter 10} describes the politically charged court of the storm giants and the challenges faced by its current ruler, @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Princess Serissa}.</p><p>If the characters earn @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa}'s trust, she tasks them with finding her father, @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton}. The search for Hekaton is handled in @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000012]{chapter 11}. Once freed from captivity, he joins forces with the party to slay the dragon @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} in @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000013]{chapter 12}. If Hekaton survives this final battle, he reclaims his throne. Otherwise, his daughter @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} becomes queen. In either event, the storm giants forge an alliance with the small folk against the enemies of giantkind: dragons. This act might be enough to restore the ordning as it was, or the future of the ordning might remain an open question in your campaign.</p><p>Once @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} is defeated, the storm giants are happy to let the characters deal with the remaining evil giant lords as they see fit.</p><p><i>Trovão do Rei das Tempestades</i> is not a \"ticking clock\" adventure, meaning that the characters are under no pressure to end the giant threat quickly. The plots of the giant lords take months to unfold, giving the characters time to explore the North, travel from place to place, and entertain distractions.</p><p>Some players might feel a sense of urgency and stick to the main story line as much as possible, missing out on many elements of the adventure. Others might be willing to follow loose threads and stray from the main story, hoping to take the adventure in interesting new directions. The adventure allows for a fair amount of wandering. If you begin to think the party has wandered too far away from the main plot, you can use @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} (see @UUID[.0000000000000003#harshnag]{chapter 3}) to help steer characters back to the main story. You can also have the characters meet faction members (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000003#peoples-of-the-north]{Factions in the North}\" section) who can provide a sense of growing urgency and point characters in the right direction.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Starting at 5th Level\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"25\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Starting at 5th Level</span></h3> <p>You can begin the adventure with 5th-level characters by skipping over @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001]{chapter 1} and starting in one of the three locations described in @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 2}. @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000013]{appendix A} suggests ways in which you can transition characters from the D&amp;D <i>Starter Set</i> adventure or one of several other D&amp;D adventures to @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 2} of <i>Trovão do Rei das Tempestades</i>.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Character Advancement\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"26\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Character Advancement</span></h3> <p>Rather than have you track experience points, this adventure assumes that the characters gain levels by accomplishing certain goals.

They test the players' ability to make smart, informed decisions under pressure. A deadly encounter might be the only encounter the characters have on a given day (and assumes the party is at full strength), or it might be so overwhelming that the characters are expected to avoid combat at all costs.</p><p>A total-party kill (\"TPK\") need not herald the end of the campaign. Giants and other intelligent creatures are fond of taking prisoners. The first time a TPK occurs, you can have the characters miraculously awaken as prisoners with 1 hit point each. Give them every chance to escape their captors. If necessary, use NPCs such as @UUID[Actor.OvAB5zfTByRnBG48]{Zephyros}, the cloud giant wizard in @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001]{chapter 1}, to help them get out of tight spots.

For example, a giant might have [[/r 3d6 * 100]]{3d6 × 100} gp in a sack. To determine the number of coins in the sack, roll [[/r 3d6]] and multiply the result by 100 to get a number between 300 and 1,800. Instead of rolling to determine the number of coins, you can pick an amount that falls within the specified range. If the characters have more loot than they known what to do with, take the minimum. If they seem light on treasure, take the average (in this case, 1,000 gp) or the maximum.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Random Magic Items\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"30\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Random Magic Items</span></h3> <p>Sometimes a treasure hoard contains one or more magic items determined by rolling on the magic item treasure tables in chapter 7 of the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,7,treasure%20tables,0\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>. When determining a random magic item, roll a [[/r d100]] (or have a player roll for you) and consult the specified table in the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,7,treasure%20tables,0\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>. If your players have a \"wish list\" of magic items, or you think a particular item might be useful to the party, you can forgo the roll and select an item from the table. For example, if the characters find a magic item tied to Magic Item Table B, and the party is light on water-breathing magic heading into @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000011]{chapter 10}, you might decide that the item is a @UUID[Item.ApQmP5mlj5IctXOM]{potion of water breathing} or a @UUID[Item.QaWYUJpSh98D1Jzk]{cloak of the manta ray}, both of which appear on Magic Item Table B in the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,7,random%20magic%20items,0\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Giant-Sized Treasures\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"31\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giant-Sized Treasures</span></h3> <p>Scattered throughout the adventure are art objects crafted to giant scale, including giant-sized pieces of jewelry, articles of clothing, and room decor. Although such art objects are often quite valuable, their size and weight make them difficult to transport. Characters must decide for themselves whether it's worth the trouble to carry these items. If the characters get greedy, use the variant encumbrance rules in the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a> to track what they can reasonably carry.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Giants' Bags\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"32\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giants' Bags</span></h3> <p>In addition to treasure, giants often possess mundane items that they carry around in leather sacks or store in old chests.

The characters gain levels by accomplishing various goals, which are summarized in the Character Advancement sidebar at the end of the chapter. If the characters are already 5th level, skip ahead to @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 2}, \"Rumblings,\" using the information in @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000013]{appendix A} if the characters are transitioning from another published adventure to this one.</p><p>Nightstone is a fortified settlement located a few miles south of the Ardeep Forest, in the untamed hills between Waterdeep and Daggerford. A lonely wooden signpost, standing where the trail to Nightstone meets the High Road, points the way to the settlement.</p><p>Nightstone's closest neighbors are the elves of the Ardeep Forest. Hunters from Nightstone have incurred the elves' wrath on multiple occasions. However, elves are the least of the settlement's problems, as fledgling heroes who come to Nightstone in search of adventure quickly discover.</p><p>The characters are traveling to Nightstone for one or more of the following reasons:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">The characters have heard rumors of @UUID[Actor.FTpa9QcNjUcitQRz]{goblins} terrorizing the settlement. The High Steward of Nightstone, Lady Velrosa Nandar, is a Waterdhavian noble. She is reportedly offering a reward to anyone willing and able to deal with the @UUID[Actor.FTpa9QcNjUcitQRz]{goblin} threat.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">Nightstone is a popular retreat for wealthy nobles who wish to hunt in the Ardeep Forest. Adventurers can earn good money by offering their services as guards on a hunt.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The residents of Nightstone have a longstanding and seemingly irreconcilable conflict with their northern neighbors, the elves of the Ardeep Forest. Lady Velrosa Nandar has been searching for skilled mediators to help resolve the dispute.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The Nightstone Inn is renowned for its food and cozy guest rooms. The dwarf innkeeper, @UUID[Actor.n5wHHVMen2aMx31b]{Morak Ur'gray}, has a fondness for adventurers and a nose for lucrative adventuring opportunities.</li></ul><p>You can create other adventure hooks using the information presented in this chapter about Nightstone.</p><p>When you and the players are ready to get underway, read:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"></span></span><p>You've been traveling along the High Road for days. As evening approaches, you spot a wooden signpost next to a trail that heads north into the hills. Nailed to the post are three arrow-shaped signs. The two marked \"Waterdeep\" and \"Daggerford\" follow the High Road but point in opposite directions. The third, marked \"Nightstone,\" beckons you to follow the trail. If memory serves, Nightstone is roughly ten miles up the trail.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Nightstone\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"34\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Nightstone</span></h1> <p>Read the following boxed text as the characters approach Nightstone.

The sound grows louder as Nightstone comes into view. A river flows around the settlement, forming a moat. The village itself is contained within a wooden palisade, beyond which you see a windmill, a tall steeple, and the high-pitched rooftops of several other buildings. Apart from the ringing of the bell, you detect no other activity in the village. The trail ends before a lowered drawbridge that spans the moat. Beyond the drawbridge, two stone watchtowers flank an open gap in the palisade.</p><p>South of the village and surrounded by the river moat is a cone-shaped, flat-topped hill on which stands a stone keep enclosed by a wooden wall. The keep, which overlooks the village, has partially collapsed. A wooden bridge that once connected the keep to the village has also partially collapsed.</p></div><p>Nightstone got its name from a massive chunk of obsidian that once stood in the middle of the village square. The obsidian megalith had strange glyphs carved into it and radiated magic under the scrutiny of @spell[detect magic] spells, but its properties and purpose couldn't be ascertained. The villagers assumed it was a relic of some bygone age or kingdom and left it alone.</p><p>Three days ago, a cloud giant castle passed over Nightstone and dropped large rocks on the settlement and its keep. Unable to defend themselves against the bombardment, villagers who weren't killed in the attack lowered the drawbridge and fled into the nearby hills, taking refuge in some caves. Once the village was abandoned, four cloud giants descended from the sky, uprooted the nightstone, and bore it back to their castle for further study, believing it to be an Ostorian artifact. The cloud castle then drifted away with its prize.</p><p>The villagers were surprised to find a clan of @UUID[Actor.FTpa9QcNjUcitQRz]{goblins} and an allied pair of @UUID[Actor.E5B1fQJu0zWYKjIR]{ogres} lurking in the caves. The villagers were ambushed, captured, and brought before Hark, the @UUID[Actor.Odvo71dYav7PTGkj]{goblin boss}. Hark interrogated them, learned of the giant attack on Nightstone, and sent a band of goblins to plunder the abandoned village. Characters who capture and interrogate these @UUID[Actor.FTpa9QcNjUcitQRz]{goblins} can learn where the villagers are located.</p><p>The following warning signs indicate that all is not well in Nightstone:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">The drawbridge (@UUID[.0000000000000001#1.-drawbridge]{area 1}) is lowered, and the perimeter watchtowers (@UUID[.0000000000000001#2.-watchtowers]{area 2}) are unguarded.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The temple bell (@UUID[.0000000000000001#5.-temple]{area 5}) won't stop ringing.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The keep (@UUID[.0000000000000001#14.-nandar-keep]{area 14}) and the bridge that connects it to the village (@UUID[.0000000000000001#11.-bridge]{area 11}) have partially collapsed.</li></ul><p>@UUID[Actor.FTpa9QcNjUcitQRz]{Goblins} are scouring the village for treasure. They have unwisely spread themselves thin, providing adventurers with an opportunity to pick them off one or two at a time. A @UUID[Actor.FTpa9QcNjUcitQRz]{goblin} that is alone and outnumbered might try to flee if it takes damage, at your discretion. If possible, the goblin retreats to the temple (@UUID[.0000000000000001#5.-temple]{area 5}). See the \"Nightstone: General Features\" sidebar for information about the settlement. Map 1.1 shows its layout. The sections that follow describe locations on that map.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Nightstone: General Features\"><h4 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"35\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Nightstone: General Features</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span title=\"Page 20\">p20</span></span></span></h4> <p>Nightstone is a motte-and-bailey fortification built on the Ardeep River.

The palisade's logs rise to sharpened points, and the gaps between the logs are sealed with tar. The palisade and its stone watchtowers (see @UUID[.0000000000000001#2.-watchtowers]{area 2}) can't be climbed without the aid of climbing gear or magic, such as a <i>spider climb</i> spell. All the buildings in the village except the watchtowers are made of wood and have steep, shingled rooftops. Muddy paths connect them.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Moat\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"37\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Moat.</span></span> Water from the river fills the moat to a depth of 15 feet. The moat is 30 feet wide, narrowing to a width of 20 feet under the drawbridge (@UUID[.0000000000000001#1.-drawbridge]{area 1}). The moat is home to schools of trout.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Motte\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"38\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Motte.</span></span> The keep overlooking the village stands atop a constructed, funnel-shaped hill called a motte. The rocky slopes of the motte are covered with loose shale, and scaling these slopes without climbing gear requires a successful [[/save ability=str dc=20]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check. Encircling the motte's keep is an 8-foot-high stone parapet with a 15-foot-high outer curtain wall made of thick wooden planks perforated with shuttered archer windows. The outer walls of the keep are made of smooth, tightly fitted stone bricks. The keep and the outer curtain wall can't be climbed without the aid of climbing gear or magic, such as a <i>spider climb</i> spell.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Rocks\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"39\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rocks.</span></span> As the characters explore Nightstone, they see ample evidence of the giants' attack: rocks embedded in the earth, holes punched through rooftops, shattered wreckage, and dead villagers buried under piles of debris. The cloud giants' rocks are 3 feet in diameter and weigh 500 pounds each.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img alt=\"Map 1.1: Nightstone\" class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/006-skt01-02-1.webp\" title=\"Map 1.1: Nightstone\"/>\n</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner\">Map 1.1: Nightstone</div></div></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img alt=\"Player Version\" class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/007-101.webp\" title=\"Player Version\"/>\n</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner\">Player Version</div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"1.

A successful check also reveals smaller humanoid tracks (made by roughly a dozen @UUID[Actor.FTpa9QcNjUcitQRz]{goblins}) heading from the north toward the drawbridge, as well as two sets of unusually large wolf tracks (made by the @UUID[Actor.Vl1c44OB3q0shUvZ]{worgs} in @UUID[.0000000000000001#3.-square]{area 3}) heading in the same direction.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"2.

The nobles of House Nandar had a hunting lodge in the forest two centuries ago, but elves forced them to abandon it. Ten years ago, members of House Nandar—Lord Drezlin Nandar and Lady Velrosa Nandar—decided it was time to return. They built a new motte-and-bailey settlement south of the Ardeep Forest and began making forays into the woods with friends to hunt and explore. Unknown to the Nandars, wood elves from Evermeet then settled in the forest, determined to protect the remnants of old elf empires from plunder and desecration. As in the past, the interests of the elves and Nandars were at cross purposes. A year ago, the conflict came to a head, and the elves attacked Nightstone. Drezlin was among the many slain—shot and killed by elf arrows while standing on the roof of his keep. His widow, Lady Velrosa Nandar, made peace with the elves and promised to make no further incursions into the Ardeep Forest—a promise she kept for the rest of her life. Velrosa was mortally wounded when the cloud giants bombarded Nightstone, leaving the village without a lord or lady to govern it.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"14.

The guards' names are Sydiri Haunlar, Torem Breck, Alara Winterspell, and Kaelen Zam. No strong leader stands among them, so they turn to the characters for guidance and leadership. If the characters question the guards about what happened, they share the following information:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">Nightstone was bombarded by rocks dropped from a giant castle in the sky. The keep was cut off from the village when a rock tore away part of the bridge.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">With nowhere to hide, the people in the village lowered the drawbridge and fled north. In the event of an attack, the villagers are supposed to retreat to the keep; with the bridge out, that was no longer an option.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">North of Nightstone, about a mile away, are some bat caves.

Known as the Seven Snakes, Xolkin's band does \"dirty work\" for the Snail, a Zhent leader based in Daggerford (see the \"Daggerford\" section in chapter 3). Their current mission is to help @UUID[Actor.xQ2TYlDIfXJHVZps]{Kella Darkhope} turn Nightstone into a base for the Black Network. The settlement's defensibility and its proximity to Waterdeep make it ideal for Zhentarim operations. The Seven Snakes had planned to infiltrate the village posing as bounty hunters in search of a wanted criminal (Kella), but they drop the ruse once it becomes apparent that the village is mostly abandoned.</p><p>Xolkin is in love with Kella and would do just about anything for her, even though he knows that she doesn't feel the same way about him. If Kella is a prisoner, Xolkin tries to buy her freedom (see \"Treasure\"). Failing that, he tries to liberate her by force. If Kella wormed her way into the characters' good graces, she reveals her allegiance to the Zhentarim once the Seven Snakes are close enough to protect her. If the party includes one or more characters with strong ties to the Black Network, Kella tries to convince them to help secure the village as a Zhentarim base.</p><p>If the characters do nothing to oppose the Zhent mercenaries, Xolkin orders his men to raise the drawbridge while he uses his @UUID[Actor.JXRsDhWLK6mQXQny]{flying snake} to send a message to the Snail, letting him know that the village is under the Black Network's control. If the characters killed Xolkin's flying snake, Xolkin orders one of his mercs to ride to Daggerford and report the news while the others \"hold down the fort.\" If combat erupts, Xolkin drinks his @UUID[Item.IKeWjhfRjE5fGJ4N]{potion of invulnerability} before leaping into the fray.</p><p>The Zhents have no easy way to reach the keep and ignore it for the time being. That said, if the Zhents learn that some of Lady Nandar's guards are holed up in the keep, they urge friendly characters to dispose of the @UUID[Actor.A8tA2fvXYY2m4iML]{guards}. Similarly, if the characters are on friendly terms with the guards in the keep, the guards ask the characters to save the village from Zhentarim occupation.</p><p>The characters are under no obligation to rid Nightstone of @UUID[Actor.xQ2TYlDIfXJHVZps]{Kella Darkhope} and the Seven Snakes. If they defeat the Zhents or come to terms with them, allow the characters to take a long rest, if they wish, before continuing with the \"Ear Seekers\" event.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Treasure\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"108\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure.</span></span> Xolkin wears a gold ring (worth 25 gp) emblazoned with the symbol of the Zhentarim: a black winged serpent.

Gurrash, the orc war chief, recently led an attack on the forest. Unfortunately for the orcs, the elves were ready for them. More than half of the orc horde perished, and the surviving orcs were forced to flee. Gurrash and several orcs escape out of the forest, make their way south, and stumble upon Nightstone. Knowing that the elves aren't far behind, Gurrash and his orcs try to fight their way into the village and make a stand there.</p><p>Gurrash, the @UUID[Actor.KtQEjZGuEyFZkBYB]{orc war chief}, is bleeding from wounds inflicted by elven arrows and has 60 hit points remaining. He leads a force consisting of twenty uninjured @creature[Orc||orcs] and an uninjured @creature[orc Eye of Gruumsh] named Norgra One-Eye. Norgra is Gurrash's lieutenant and assumes command if the war chief dies.</p><p>The orcs have no gear other than their weapons and armor. If the drawbridge is lowered, they rush toward it and try to storm the village, killing other creatures in their path. If the drawbridge is raised, the orcs swim across the moat and try to climb the palisade, with no success. After being thwarted by the palisade, Gurrash sends scouts downriver to find another point of entry. It takes these orcs 10 minutes to realize that they can enter the village through the gap in the palisade where the bridge (@UUID[.0000000000000001#11.-bridge]{area 11}) leads up to the keep. Once the orcs enter the village, they fight to the death and don't take prisoners. Because the orcs don't know what they're up against, characters can try to hide in the village and pick off a few orcs at a time. They can also retreat to the keep, which the orcs ignore.</p><p>If the @creature[Orc||orcs] lose more than half their number without gaining a foothold in the village, the survivors flee into the surrounding hills. Once the @creature[Orc||orcs] are defeated, the characters can advance to 3rd level and head to the Dripping Caves to locate and retrieve the missing villagers. If they're not sure where the villagers went, @UUID[Actor.xQ2TYlDIfXJHVZps]{Kella Darkhope} or the guards in the keep can point them in the right direction.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Strange Bedfellows\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"110\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Strange Bedfellows.</span></span> If the characters came to terms with the Black Network in the previous event and the Seven Snakes are still around when the orcs arrive, the Zhents help the party defend Nightstone. Xolkin and Kella aren't heroes and don't place themselves in unnecessary danger, but they are quick to raise the drawbridge or position defenders on the watchtowers as needed.

Rising up from the middle of the floor is a particularly large (10-foot-tall) stalagmite riddled with 4-inch-wide, 12-inch-deep naturally formed holes that bore down into a hollow central cavity. Lying near the base of the stalagmite are the badly corroded remains of two goblin scimitars.</p><p>A @UUID[Actor.x0jkolRvLHvgqaky]{black pudding} has taken residence inside the stalagmite's hollow core, and the holes in the stalagmite's \"shell\" are wide enough that a character can stick an arm, a staff, or a weapon into any one of them. The pudding makes a free pseudopod attack against anything that is inserted into one of the stalagmite's holes.</p><p>The pudding has &amp;Reference[rule=totalcover]{total cover} while inside the stalagmite's core. If left undisturbed, the pudding remains inside the stalagmite until the characters make their way toward @UUID[.0000000000000001#3b.-water-supply]{area 3b}, whereupon it quietly emerges and follows them.

The goblins used to come here to drink fresh water, but they stopped visiting the cave when the black pudding in @UUID[.0000000000000001#3a.-the-blob]{area 3a} started picking them off.</p><p>Growing near the southeast wall is a patch of twenty green mushrooms. A character who inspects the mushrooms and succeeds on a [[/save ability=int dc=10]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Nature]) check can ascertain that they are poisonous. Any creature that ingests a mushroom must succeed on a [[/save ability=con dc=10]] saving throw or take 1 poison damage and be &amp;Reference[condition=poisoned] for 1 hour. The effects of eating multiple mushrooms are cumulative.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"4. Bats and Prisoners\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"130\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">4. Bats and Prisoners</span></h2> <p>A short tunnel leads to a sunken cavern that echoes with the sound of flapping wings. The sound emanates from a naturally formed pit in the cavern's floor, which is covered with bat guano. Ten-foot-high ledges surround the pit and form raised alcoves to the north, east, and south. Huddled in these alcoves are thirty Nightstone villagers. The villagers are prisoners of the goblins and ogres, and they are trying to remain as quiet as possible for reasons that might not be readily apparent to the characters.</p><p>Directly below this cavern is another similarly sized cavern filled with thousands of @UUID[Actor.HbqUym1RKkaRzhZh]{bats}. Any loud noise in either cavern agitates the bats. When the bats become agitated, have the characters roll initiative. On initiative count 10, the bats fly up the pit and flutter about the upper cave, shrieking loudly. The fluttering bats reduce visibility in the upper cavern to 5 feet. A creature takes 1 piercing damage whenever it enters a 5-foot-square area filled with fluttering @UUID[Actor.HbqUym1RKkaRzhZh]{bats}. At the start of each of the bats' turns, roll a [[/r d6]]. On a roll of 1–5, the bats remain agitated. On a roll of 6, the bats return to the lower cavern and are no longer agitated.</p><p>The pit descends through 20 feet of solid rock before opening into the lower cavern, which is 30 feet deep.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Nightstone Villagers\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"131\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Nightstone Villagers</span></h3> <p>Boss Hark stripped the villagers of their weapons before herding them into this cavern. The villagers fear for their lives but can't escape the Dripping Caves until the monsters in @UUID[.0000000000000001#1.-drawbridge]{area 1} are defeated. Every few hours, one of the @UUID[Actor.E5B1fQJu0zWYKjIR]{ogres} enters the cave, grabs a prisoner, and takes the unfortunate villager away to be eaten (if not by the @UUID[Actor.E5B1fQJu0zWYKjIR]{ogres}, then by the @UUID[Actor.FTpa9QcNjUcitQRz]{goblins} in @UUID[.0000000000000001#2.-watchtowers]{area 2} or the @UUID[Actor.vRORcMWoMMBeMeDU]{rats} in @UUID[.0000000000000001#9.-trading-post]{area 9}).</p><p>In the absence of a true leader, @UUID[Actor.n5wHHVMen2aMx31b]{Morak Ur'gray} (LG male shield dwarf @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}), the owner and proprietor of the Nightstone Inn, speaks on behalf of the villagers. Morak is an optimist, and he's counting on Lady Velrosa Nandar coming to the rescue. When he lays eyes on the adventurers, he breathes a sigh of relief and assumes they were hired by Lady Nandar. (He would be dismayed to learn that she didn't survive the attack on Nightstone.)</p><p>Other noteworthy prisoners trapped in the cavern include Hiral Mystrum (LG male Tethyrian human @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}), the village's cowardly priest of Lathander, and six unarmed @UUID[Actor.A8tA2fvXYY2m4iML]{guards} (LN male and female @UUID[Actor.A8tA2fvXYY2m4iML]{guards} of various ethnicities).

If the characters kill one or more of the dwarves or deal damage to the dragon, they are accused of conspiring with giants to bring about the downfall of dwarven civilization in the North. The strike team turns on the party, attempting to knock the characters &amp;Reference[condition=unconscious] instead of killing them.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Development\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"158\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Development</span></h3> <p>A character can try to persuade the dragon and the dwarves to end their assault by convincing them that @UUID[Actor.OvAB5zfTByRnBG48]{Zephyros} means no harm. If the player roleplays well and makes a convincing argument, allow the character to use an action to make a [[/save ability=cha dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Persuasion]) check, with advantage if the character is a member of the Lords' Alliance, and with disadvantage if one or more members of the strike team are dead. If the check fails, the dwarves say they \"can't take any chances\" and press forward with their plan, though the character can try again. If the check succeeds, the dragon and the dwarves call off the attack.</p><p>If the dwarves destroy the @UUID[Item.gB7GURLoCPkD9Qbv]{navigation orb}, the tower is stranded until @UUID[Actor.OvAB5zfTByRnBG48]{Zephyros} crafts a replacement (which could take months). Rather than strand the characters in his tower, he helps them return to the surface, points them in the right direction, and bids them farewell before returning to his tower to ponder his options.</p><p>If the strike team is thwarted or calls off the mission, the dwarves ask Clarion to fly them back to Mithral Hall. If the dwarves are killed, the dragon returns to Mithral Hall alone.

You decide which location to use: the walled town of Bryn Shander in the cold heart of Icewind Dale; Goldenfields, a fortified farming settlement and abbey northeast of Waterdeep; or Triboar, a frontier town and caravan rest stop in the Dessarin Valley. This chapter includes a map and a detailed overview of each settlement. The attacking giants have a specific goal. If the characters help defend the location against the giants' onslaught and succeed in defeating or driving off the attackers, the characters are rewarded with quests that lead them deeper into the adventure. Be warned: these encounters are designed to test the party's leadership and tactical skills, and characters who don't exercise some degree of caution will likely perish.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Special NPCs\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"161\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Special NPCs</span></h1> <p>In this chapter, each player runs not only a player character but also an NPC who has ties to the settlement that the characters are defending. Once you've determined where the adventure begins, make photocopies of the six NPCs corresponding to the location you've chosen. These NPCs are gathered in @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}. Each NPC comes with a brief description, personality traits (a bond, an ideal, and a flaw), and a stat block. When the giant attack begins, give one NPC to each player and tell the player where the NPC is at the start of the encounter, as noted in the encounter description. If your group has more than six players, one or more of them won't receive an NPC, and that's okay. (Let the players decide who gets one and who doesn't.) If your group has fewer than six players, give one NPC to each player and put the extra NPCs aside. These leftover NPCs don't participate in the battle.</p><p>After giving out the NPCs, read the following explanatory text to the players:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"></span></span><p>In addition to your character, each of you has received a special nonplayer character with ties to the location where the adventure begins. Take a moment to review your NPC's personality traits and statistics. One of your goals in this part of the adventure is to keep your special NPC alive. For each of these NPCs that survives, your party will receive a special quest that yields a reward upon its successful completion. The details of these special quests won't be revealed until the end of this part of the adventure.</p></div><p>The player-controlled NPCs are intentionally simpler and easier to run than the players' own characters, and the NPCs help bring the location to life. The players will be far more inclined to defend the location knowing that its inhabitants are more than just faceless figures with hit points. These NPCs are predisposed to aid in their settlement's defense, but players might try to keep them out of harm's way instead. Each NPC has an ideal, a bond, and a flaw, and though you should encourage players to roleplay these traits accurately, players can portray the NPCs as they choose.</p><p>Rather than have each player roll initiative for a special NPC, assume that the NPC acts on the same initiative count as the player's character, immediately after that character's turn. If an enemy is forced to choose between attacking a player character or an NPC, assume it attacks the NPC unless it has a strong incentive to do otherwise.</p><p>At the end of the battle, regardless of the outcome, take back all the special NPCs. For each NPC who survives, give the characters that NPC's corresponding special quest. A special quest is imparted even if the NPC didn't participate in the battle. These special quests shouldn't be revealed to the players until you're ready to move on to the next part of the adventure. Once the dust has settled, the surviving NPCs approach the characters and present their quests (not necessarily all at once). The characters are under no obligation to accept and complete a quest, though doing so usually leads to some kind of reward.</p><p>The adventurers don't receive any quest (or the reward gained from completing it) that is tied to an NPC who dies and isn't brought back to life using a @spell[revivify] spell or some other means.</p><p>If you are running the adventure for inexperienced players, you can run one or more of the special NPCs yourself and use them to assist or advise the player characters, rather than have the players run the NPCs in addition to their own characters. If the NPCs survive the battle, award one special quest per character in the party.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Bryn Shander\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"162\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bryn Shander</span></h1> <p>Bryn Shander is the largest of ten settlements known collectively as Ten-Towns, located in the frigid heart of Icewind Dale. Here, caravans from the south converge with traders from across Icewind Dale to swap goods and rumors. Fishers, trappers, furriers, and sellswords rub elbows in the town's taprooms, and gruff dwarves, wide-eyed travelers, and skulking ne'er-do-wells wander its streets. Merchants from the south trade dyes, hardwood, dried herbs and spices, textiles, fruits, wines, and other commodities for scrimshaw and other items made from the bones of the knucklehead trout that populate the region's rivers and lakes.</p><p>The town is situated atop a hill south of the mountain known as Kelvin's Cairn, a major landmark in Icewind Dale. From its windswept perch, Bryn Shander has a commanding view of the surrounding tundra, and an attacking force must climb the barren hillside under fire from archers before it can assault the outer wall. The circular wall that surrounds Bryn Shander stands 30 feet high and is made of tight-fitting stone blocks. Defenders stand atop a planked walkway that hugs interior of the wall. Spaced along the wall are stone watchtowers, wherein guards can take shelter during blizzards and warm their hands and feet by iron stoves.</p><p>The buildings of Bryn Shander are plain wooden structures with pitched rooftops to keep snow from settling on them. Clouds of white smoke issue forth day and night from stone chimneys and holes in rooftops.</p><p>Each community in Ten-Towns has an elected speaker who leads the residents and represents their interests. The current speaker of Bryn Shander is @UUID[Actor.oI3uUlFutYQdfjEa]{Duvessa Shane}. She has appointed @UUID[Actor.FtUPRWZ2HghiEmy7]{Markham Southwell} as her sheriff, making him responsible for training the town's militia and keeping the peace.</p><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img alt=\"Map 2.1: Bryn Shander\" class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/016-skt02-02.webp\" title=\"Map 2.1: Bryn Shander\"/>\n</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner\">Map 2.1: Bryn Shander</div></div></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img alt=\"Player Version\" class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/017-201.webp\" title=\"Player Version\"/>\n</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner\">Player Version</div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Locations in Bryn Shander\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"163\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Locations in Bryn Shander</span></h2> <p>The following locations are identified on map 2.1.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"B1. Outer Gates\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"164\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B1. Outer Gates</span></h3> <p>The town has three sets of 15-foot-high hinged wooden gates, dubbed the North Gate, the East Gate, and the Southwest Gate. These gates can be barred from the inside with heavy, iron-banded hardwood beams. Barred gates have AC 15, 200 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Forcing open a set of barred gates requires a successful [[/save ability=str dc=28]] check.</p><p>Two 30-foot-tall cylindrical stone towers flank each gate and watch over one of the trails that lead to and from the town. The trail from the North Gate travels two miles north to the village of Targos on the frozen shore of a lake called Maer Dualdon. The trail leading east, called the Eastway, stretches roughly thirteen miles to the town of Easthaven on the shore of Lac Dinneshere. The southwest route, known as the Caravan Trail, is called the Ten Trail where it passes through the Spine of the World. This trail is the safest way to the lands south of the mountains, but it is nigh impassable in the winter.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, the gates of Bryn Shander stand open, and the guards assigned to the gatehouses say and do nothing as people come and go. When Bryn Shander is threatened, however, the guards close and bar the gates, refusing to open them unless ordered to do so by the sheriff or the speaker. There are four guards at each gate at any given time. Another eight guards are on patrol, moving between the stone watchtowers along the wall. Most of the guards are human, with a sprinkling of shield dwarves, half-orcs, and other races.</p><p>A sheriff's deputy named @UUID[Actor.lNGHjGCoEOoVKMPa]{Augrek Brighthelm} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}) often stands watch at the southwest gate. She delights in greeting first-time visitors to town. In fact, she has a well-rehearsed speech that makes some of the other guards at the gate roll their eyes: \"Well met, travelers! Keep yer fingers and extremities under wraps, lest Auril bite them off! Mind yer tempers, and you'll be most welcome here! Brought goods to sell? The market lies straight ahead. Craving a warm drink? May I recommend a drop of Firebeard's Firebrandy, sold only at Kelvin's Comfort, located on yer right as you enter the market square!\" (If the characters arrive at a different gate, you can relocate Augrek to that gate.)</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"B2. Stables\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"165\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B2. Stables</span></h3> <p>These stables stand against the outer wall. Any horse, pony, or mule brought into the city can be quartered here and fed for 1 sp per night.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"B3. Council Hall\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"166\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B3. Council Hall</span></h3> <p>Located near the southwest gate, the council hall is a nondescript warehouse where the speakers of Ten-Towns engage in discussions about matters that concern their communities. When no meetings are in session, the building stands empty. In the event of a crisis that affects the other settlements of Ten-Towns, the council hall can be converted into a shelter for refugees.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"B4. House of the Triad\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"167\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B4. House of the Triad</span></h3> <p>Bryn Shander's largest place of worship, the only one that truly deserves to be called a temple, is an impressive stone edifice built by the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn. The House of the Triad stands about halfway between the southwest gate and the central market. It honors the three gods known as the Triad: Tyr, the god of justice; Torm, the god of courage and self-sacrifice; and Ilmater, the god of endurance in the face of suffering.</p><p>The temple is attended and maintained by visiting priests and acolytes from Neverwinter and Waterdeep, who usually stay for no more than two years before returning whence they came. At present, the temple is home to a priest of Torm from Neverwinter named Dellvon Ludwig (LG male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.BSvzE801ExHkxapo]{priest}) and his faithful friend, @UUID[Actor.eTHyRUSCBOF4a7Jl]{Sirac of Suzail} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}).</p><p>Sirac knows that he's a son of the immortal Artus Cimber and thus carries the Cimber bloodline, not that it has ever benefited him. Artus's immortality, it is said, comes from a magic ring—a ring that Sirac has never seen. Sirac's parents gave him up as a baby; he was raised in an orphanage and learned his survival skills as a teenager living on the streets of Suzail. He traveled west with a caravan to Baldur's Gate, then sailed up the Sword Coast to Neverwinter. He came to Icewind Dale three months ago to try his hand at knucklehead trout fishing, and ended up befriending Dellvon Ludwig. Sirac has since come to appreciate Torm's mantra, espousing courage and heroism above all.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"B5.

Speaker's Palace</span></h3> <p>The Speaker's Palace is the private residence of the town speaker. The \"palace\" part of its name is an overstatement, compared to such buildings elsewhere in the world. Yet, fashioned by dwarves out of cut stone, with a pitched slate roof and a colonnade in front, the palace is so out of place among the rough wood dwellings in Bryn Shander that it looks as if it had been magically transported here from some other region of Faerûn.</p><p>The current elected speaker, @UUID[Actor.oI3uUlFutYQdfjEa]{Duvessa Shane} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}), is the daughter of a trader from Waterdeep who settled in Bryn Shander after she fell in love with a local tavern server. Duvessa inherited her mother's talent for negotiation and her father's charm, and she can argue and debate for hours without tiring. Others might bristle at her temerity, but she usually gets what she wants.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"B6. Town Hall\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"169\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B6. Town Hall</span></h3> <p>Bryn Shander's town hall is the largest building that borders the central square. It is reserved for community feasts and gatherings on various holy days and other notable events. The hall can also accommodate refugees from neighboring settlements in times of emergency.</p><p>In the back of the hall is a short flight of stone steps that lead down to a sunken cellar with walls of frozen, hard-packed earth. The cellar has been converted into a sheriff's office and an adjoining jail cell. The sheriff, @UUID[Actor.FtUPRWZ2HghiEmy7]{Markham Southwell} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}), spends little time here, and the jail cell is usually unoccupied. When troublemakers need to be locked up, two deputies (LN male or female Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.A8tA2fvXYY2m4iML]{guards}) are assigned to watch over them. Sheriff Southwell carries the key to the cell door, which can be picked open with thieves' tools and a successful [[/save ability=dex dc=15]] check. If the guards need to get into the cell for some reason, one of them leaves to fetch the sheriff while the other waits.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"B7. Marketplace\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"170\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B7. Marketplace</span></h3> <p>The marketplace is a roughly circular space in the center of town where local and foreign traders sell their wares. Tents and covered wagons provide some shelter against the cold wind, but not much. In a few places, campfires with people huddled around them crackle and smoke.</p><p>One heavily bundled figure commonly seen loitering about the market square is a haggard, homeless young woman named @UUID[Actor.nujigulfgyMjG3OS]{Beldora} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}). She wears boots that are much too big for her feet, and thick gloves made from walrus hide. She earns coin by helping to tend other folks' campfires, staying warm and overhearing rumors at the same time.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.nujigulfgyMjG3OS]{Beldora}'s secret is that she's a Harper agent. She likes to huddle next to strangers and learn what they know. She conceals a @UUID[Item.UkTH8Qm3f9FMv1qC]{sending stone} on her person and uses it once a day to pass along information to Thwip Ironbottom, a Harper agent based in Hundelstone.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"B8. Kelvin's Comfort\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"171\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B8. Kelvin's Comfort</span></h3> <p>The most popular tavern in town, owing to its extensive stock of dwarven ales and brandies, is Kelvin's Comfort. The common room is bedecked with dwarven craft of Battlehammer make, but most of the liquors are imported from Mirabar, on the other side of the Spine of the World. The one Ten-Towns specialty of note is a treacly mead from Good Mead, a neighboring settlement. Caravan masters and guards with plenty of coin often come here, as do visiting dwarves from Kelvin's Cairn. The proprietor of Kelvin's Comfort is Ogden Flamebeard (NG male shield dwarf @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}), who has a temper as fiery as his signature drink—a Mirabarran rotgut he gets for cheap and rebottles as Flamebeard's Firebrandy (reselling it at a sizable markup). In his youth, Ogden worked in many famous mines, and he has contacts throughout the dwarfholds of the North, including Mithral Hall.</p><p>One of the patrons of Kelvin's Comfort is @UUID[Actor.Gqnc5DfD5jfW0pu3]{Sir Baric Nylef} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}), a knight of Tyr and a member of the Order of the Gauntlet. He's hoping that a few shots of Flamebeard's Firebrandy will keep a nasty cold at bay while he keeps an eye out for a dwarf named Worvil \"@UUID[Actor.iT53Zqg0fmjvTwUm]{the Weevil}\" Forkbeard, a criminal rumored to be hiding in Ten-Towns. @UUID[Actor.iT53Zqg0fmjvTwUm]{The Weevil} led a gang of dwarf brigands that raided summer caravans traveling between Luskan and Mirabar. He also spearheaded several raids on the Mines of Mirabar, stealing food and drink mainly. The Order of the Gauntlet captured most of his gang, but Worvil disappeared into the mountains. Interrogation of the captives led Baric to discover @UUID[Actor.iT53Zqg0fmjvTwUm]{the Weevil}'s mad craving for Flamebeard's Firebrandy. So, Baric has adopted the guise of an unemployed caravan guard, and his plan is to hang around Kelvin's Comfort for a few days, on the chance that his quarry will walk right through the door.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"B9. Armory\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"172\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B9. Armory</span></h3> <p>The town armory is situated just off the central square.

Blackiron Blades\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"173\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B10. Blackiron Blades</span></h3> <p>This small shop and smithy stands just north of the town square and is well known as a one-stop shop for adventurers and other travelers in the region. Rather than attempting to compete with the dwarf-crafted weapons from Kelvin's Cairn, the smith, Garn (N male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}), makes his living by manufacturing the cheapest blades in Ten-Towns. His sister, Elza (NG female Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}), runs the shop. Elza has expanded the business in recent years by offering a selection of adventuring supplies—rations, fur cloaks, leather gloves and boots, ice picks, snowshoes, and other survival gear. While a Blackiron weapon typically sells for half the price listed in the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,4\">Player's Handbook</a>, Elza marks up other goods by 50 percent to keep the business profitable. Most of the town's veteran sellswords disdain Garn's smithcraft, and jokes told about hapless newcomers to Icewind Dale often end with the line \"... an' 'e was carryin' a Blackiron blade, to boot!\"</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"B11. The Hooked Knucklehead\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"174\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B11. The Hooked Knucklehead</span></h3> <p>This longstanding inn caters to the scrimshanders and traders who come to Bryn Shander from other towns to conduct business. The innkeeper, Barton (NG male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}), doesn't meddle in his clients' affairs. The accommodations are meager, and the few private rooms lack hearths and are bitterly cold at night. Most of the clientele sleeps in the spacious common room, near the large stone hearth.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"B12. Rendaril's Emporium\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"175\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B12. Rendaril's Emporium</span></h3> <p>This is the largest trade house in Bryn Shander, on the site of the original cabin around which the town sprang up. The entrance facing the market square serves as the storefront, where visitors can view an assortment of the finest goods for sale in all of Ten-Towns: fishing rods fashioned from elven yew, yeti-skin coats with scrimshaw buttons, mithral fishhooks, axe heads and daggers crafted by the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn, and more. Around the back of the building is an entrance for wholesalers, where caravan traders offload their stock and local adventurers sell pelts and tusks collected on their travels. The owner, Rendaril (CG male half-elf @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}), is a shrewd merchant who learned his trade in the cutthroat markets of Waterdeep. More coin passes through his hands in a week than most other businesses in Bryn Shander see in a season.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"B13. The Northlook\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"176\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B13. The Northlook</span></h3> <p>The Northlook is the inn most frequented by mercenaries and adventurers, and as such it's the rowdiest and most dangerous place to stay in Bryn Shander. At the same time, its taproom is the best place in all of Ten-Towns to get the latest news and rumors, including leads on profitable ventures. The proprietor, a retired sellsword who goes by the name Scramsax (N male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.iDlg4HChHwAG5ADN]{veteran}), takes advantage of the high hopes and good fortunes of his customers by charging the most exorbitant rates in town. (His prices for room and board are double those listed in the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,4\">Player's Handbook</a>.) Scramsax often cuts a break for customers who are between jobs, allowing them to stay on credit and then presenting them with a bill inflated by interest charges after they earn their next payday.

Geldenstag's Rest</span></h3> <p>One of the oldest inns in town, Geldenstag's Rest is run by Myrtle (LN female Illuskan human noncombatant), a gray-haired widow. Myrtle makes it her business to know everyone else's business, asking her guests a lot of questions about what they're up to each day. The inn's accommodations are lackluster—the small rooms are furnished with only a stool, a chamber pot, and two cots with dirty furs thrown over them. It might seem the kind of place that would attract lowlifes and troublemakers, but Myrtle's pestering tends to drive away people who have secrets to keep. The absence of that element from its clientele makes Geldenstag's Rest a popular destination for travelers who aren't looking for too much excitement during their stay in Bryn Shander.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Attack on Bryn Shander\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"178\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Attack on Bryn Shander</span></h2> <p>Twelve @UUID[Actor.0e4VCY9QHJ0DVAAa]{frost giants} come to Bryn Shander looking for Artus Cimber and the <i>Ring of Winter</i>.

Bryn Shander's market square bustles with knucklehead trout fishers selling their finest scrimshaw to traders from the south, while other common folk warm their hands and faces by small campfires. Everywhere across town, people are trudging through snow-covered streets on errands. The town's outer walls block the worst of the wind, but not all of it. A sudden blast occasionally catches everyone by surprise, causing shivers and grumbling all around.</p><p>The mood of the town changes abruptly. Something is amiss. Pedestrians are vacating the square with great haste, disappearing into their hovels. As spear-toting guards with grim faces move with purpose toward the southwest gate, you hear a booming voice from that direction as it calls out, \"Surrender Artus Cimber or die!\"</p></div><p>The frost giants believe that a male human named Artus Cimber is holed up in Bryn Shander, and Drufi demands that the town hand over Artus and all of his possessions to her immediately. Duvessa and Markham know of no such person, and no such person steps forward.</p><p>Drufi carries a horn made from a mammoth's tusk and can blow it as an action. The horn can be heard out to a range of one mile. If her demands aren't met immediately, Drufi uses the horn to signal the other frost giants, who advance to within 100 feet of the town and begin hurling rocks over the walls, not targeting anyone or anything specifically but looking to cause widespread panic. As townsfolk take cover, Drufi and her two giant bodyguards try to break down the southwest gate and fight their way inside. While this is happening, a young man named Sirac at the House of the Triad learns what the giants are after and realizes he might be able to save the town.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Defense of Bryn Shander\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"180\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Defense of Bryn Shander</span></h3> <p>The threat of a full-scale frost giant attack throws the town of Bryn Shander into chaos.

She warns the characters that the dwarves of Ironmaster don't allow non-dwarves inside their lands. But, she says, if the characters travel toward Ironmaster, stand next to one of its menhirs, and wait, some dwarves will eventually approach them. If the characters announce that they've come on behalf of Augrek, one of her older cousins, Gwert Brighthelm (LN male dwarf @UUID[Actor.XgAjpoJSv5Bqo6gO]{noble} armed with a warhammer instead of a rapier), will be summoned to hear what the characters have to say.

Although he doesn't know his father's present whereabouts, Sirac recalls that Artus had connections to the Roaringhorns, a noble family in Waterdeep. He urges the characters to visit the Roaringhorn estate in Waterdeep and speak to someone there. Fearing that the frost giants might come after him again, Sirac offers to accompany the characters as far south as Luskan, where he can catch a ship heading south. Guided by @UUID[Actor.WCaTcC0r6QQDgeSR]{Jarl Storvald}'s @UUID[Item.STjByzekFu3NhKKO]{blod stone}, the frost giants continue hunting for Sirac. If the characters allow Sirac to accompany them, assume that any frost giants that appear in a random encounter are searching for him.</p><p>If they travel to Waterdeep, the characters learn that the Roaringhorn family has a villa, called the High House of Roaringhorn, in the city's North Ward. Although it's one of the grandest residences in Waterdeep, and currently hosting one of its many infamous parties, this one a welcome celebration for visiting relatives from Cormyr. Upon their arrival, the adventurers are greeted by Lord Zelraun Roaringhorn (LN male Chondathan human @UUID[Actor.tYFhaFeqOwyJdTzs]{archmage}). Having quaffed a few @UUID[Item.CBby9BqnteKKmYPb]{potions of longevity} in his lifetime, he has the appearance and vigor of a thirty-year-old despite his being a couple decades older than that. A @UUID[Actor.iyGRF6JrXgwhygVE]{shield guardian} accompanies Zelraun at all times. Zelraun tells the characters (truthfully) that he has no idea where Artus is, and all prior attempts to divine his whereabouts or scry on him with magic have failed. Zelraun hides the fact that both he and Artus are Harpers, although he secretly suspects Artus has \"gone rogue.\" Even if Zelraun knew where Artus was, it would be improper for him to divulge such information and potentially expose another member of the Harpers to harm.</p><p>Zelraun asks the characters who sent them in his direction.

Duvessa writes a letter to her aunt, Inirva Coldwater, asking her to provide passage and accommodations to the characters if they need to travel up or down the Sword Coast.</p><p>If the characters seek out information about the <i>Dancing Wave</i>, they learn that the ship is missing and several weeks overdue. It was transporting goods from Luskan to Waterdeep when it disappeared. Rumor has it that Neverwinter privateers aboard a ship called the <i>Moon Maiden</i> sighted floating debris while traveling south to Waterdeep.</p><p>The characters can find Osk Thunderhale (CN male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.uXGxDbtKu6GmgNFF]{bandit captain}), the captain of the <i>Moon Maiden</i>, taking it easy at the Hanging Lantern, a festhall near Waterdeep's docks. Thunderhale is a skilled fiddler (&amp;Reference[skill=Performance] +6). In fact, he's playing his fiddle to amuse his crew and other festhall patrons when the characters show up to question him.</p><p>If they confront him, Thunderhale takes umbrage and tries to pick a fight. Twelve members of the <i>Moon Maiden</i> crew (CN male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.mi7jBroOT38LUqCV]{bandits}) stand ready to leap into the fray. If the characters reduce Thunderhale to 32 hit points or fewer, he surrenders, smiles, and offers his hand in friendship while complimenting the characters on their fighting prowess. If the characters defuse the situation by not responding to his initial attack, Thunderhale is just as pleased. He pays for their drinks and covers any damage to the festhall, then claims to be in the employ of Lord Dagult Neverember of Neverwinter.</p><p>Thunderhale has no proof that the debris he saw came from the <i>Dancing Wave</i>, but he's aware of no other Waterdhavian merchant ships that have gone missing of late. Furthermore, he claims to have seen \"a ship as big as a mountain\" prowling the northern waters and thinks it might have attacked and destroyed the <i>Dancing Wave</i>. If the characters express interest in mounting a search, either for the <i>Dancing Wave</i> or the mysterious vessel, Captain Thunderhale commits his ship and crew for 10 gp per day and two-thirds of whatever spoils are found. He can be talked down to an even split of the spoils with a successful [[/save ability=cha dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Persuasion]) check. Once a deal is reached, Thunderhale agrees to set sail whenever the characters are ready to depart, and he reminds them that they must secure their own provisions.</p><p>The <i>Moon Maiden</i> is anchored in the bay and can be reached by rowboat. Eight crew members (CN male and female Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.mi7jBroOT38LUqCV]{bandits}) stand watch on deck while the ship is in port.

Characters can present the letter to the town speaker of any other Ten-Towns settlement and expect to receive free room and board.</p><p>You can plan encounters as the characters explore Icewind Dale using the random encounter table in the \"Icewind Dale\" section in chapter 3. After encountering one or more frost giants, they can return to Bryn Shander and report to the sheriff. If they return with the heads of one or more slain giants, Sheriff Southwell rewards each of them with the title \"Defender of Icewind Dale\" and spreads news of the party's heroism throughout Ten-Towns. As long as the characters do nothing to sully their reputations, Ten-Towners are friendly toward them and extend them every courtesy.</p><p>Shortly after the characters earn their new titles, they are approached by a pair of freelance bounty hunters named Sorelisa Zandra (N female Tethyrian human @UUID[Actor.BWrtdHO2w27ozfLx]{spy}) and Naeremos (N male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.dleF6z2lXhdoBTLV]{thug}).

They are searching for a dwarf fugitive known as @UUID[Actor.iT53Zqg0fmjvTwUm]{the Weevil}, who is wanted for banditry. Sorelisa shows the characters a crude sketch of @UUID[Actor.iT53Zqg0fmjvTwUm]{the Weevil} (a dark-haired dwarf with a mad gleam in his eyes) and asks them if they know his whereabouts, while failing to mention that the city of Mirabar has placed a 5,000 gp bounty on @UUID[Actor.iT53Zqg0fmjvTwUm]{the Weevil}'s head.</p><p>The Zhentarim wants to protect and recruit @UUID[Actor.iT53Zqg0fmjvTwUm]{the Weevil}, not turn him over to the Mirabar authorities. Zhentarim operatives stationed in various cities of the North have seen neither hide nor hair of him, leading Sorelisa to suspect that @UUID[Actor.iT53Zqg0fmjvTwUm]{the Weevil} is hiding in one of the smaller settlements.

Called \"the Granary of the North,\" it's the only reason many Northerners ever taste soft-fleshed fruit larger than bush berries. Waterdeep and its neighbors consume the temple's reliable output: carefully husbanded grains and dried, oil-packed, or salted foodstuffs preserved in vast storage cellars, vats, and squat stone grain-towers.</p><p>Run by Abbot Ellardin Darovik, Goldenfields is a stronghold of the Emerald Enclave. Members of that faction are as welcome here as clergy of Chauntea; many of them stay for months at a time to help with the work and the vigilant defense of the farm against insects and blights, as well as would-be vandals and plunderers. Hired guards and adventurers patrol the walls and the land immediately around them. Inside the farm, young @UUID[Actor.qx9gH0Z4iSFmPfNr]{treants} allied with the Emerald Enclave hide within stands of trees, ready to animate trees to repel invaders. More than five thousand people live and work in Goldenfields year round, farming more than twenty square miles of tillage in gangs of hard-working gardeners.</p><p>The sprawling temple-farm is built on higher ground than the surrounding fields, and it's enclosed on all sides by a wall of mortared stone. The outer wall is 60 feet high (20 feet high inside the compound) and 30 feet wide. The wall is built out at several points, spaced at least a mile apart, with stone pagodas and barracks at those locations. These watch posts have unobstructed views of the surrounding countryside.</p><p>The outer wall is in need of repair in many places.

Scaling the walls requires a successful [[/save ability=str dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check.</p><p>The entrance to Goldenfields is a large stone gatehouse set into the middle of the south wall. Beyond its gates, dirt roads crisscross the interior of the compound, providing passage between and through its fields and orchards. Roads also run along the inside of the wall, connecting the various watch posts. During the harvest season, wagons make their way between the fields, gathering food and grain and transporting it to cellars beneath the watch posts, where the food is kept under lock and key until caravans from Waterdeep and other settlements arrive to pick it up. In addition to the large grain fields, fruit orchards, and vegetable gardens, smaller gardens hug the outer walls. These gardens grow berries, rhubarb plants, and other such fare.</p><p>Most of Goldenfields' workers live in a small town situated near the abbey, where the abbot hosts morning, noon, and evening prayer. North of town is an enormous inn called Northfurrow's End. Visitors planning to spend the night in Goldenfields are directed here.</p><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img alt=\"Map 2.2: Goldenfields\" class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/018-goldenfields-1.webp\" title=\"Map 2.2: Goldenfields\"/>\n</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner\">Map 2.2: Goldenfields</div></div></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img alt=\"Player Version\" class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/019-202.webp\" title=\"Player Version\"/>\n</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner\">Player Version</div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Goldenfields Locations\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"199\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goldenfields Locations</span></h2> <p>The following locations are identified on map 2.2.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"G1. Gatehouse\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"200\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">G1. Gatehouse</span></h3> <p>The Northfurrow trail ends before a magnificent stone gatehouse carved with images of a full-bodied woman (representations of Chauntea) cradling cornucopias. The gatehouse is a fortress in its own right. Above its tall, thick wooden doors are arrow slits that seem to peer down suspiciously on all visitors.</p><p>The gatehouse has an inner set and an outer set of double doors. When locked, these doors are too thick to be forced open using brute strength. They can be damaged and broken down, however. Each set of doors has AC 16, 500 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p><p>The gatehouse staff operates in three daily shifts that end at five bells in the morning, one bell in the afternoon, and nine bells at night, respectively. Each shift consists of a @UUID[Actor.BSvzE801ExHkxapo]{priest} of Chauntea (NG male or female Illuskan human), four @UUID[Actor.qFwpg1AoUJSor5U6]{acolytes} (NG male and female humans of mixed ethnicity), a hired @UUID[Actor.sMYXCW2K2ptMY1Wb]{mage} (N male or female Illuskan human), ten @UUID[Actor.LTrMewUTBVyx4vkZ]{scouts} (N male and female humans of various ethnicities) hidden behind arrow slits, and thirty well-trained @UUID[Actor.A8tA2fvXYY2m4iML]{guards} (N male and female humans of various ethnicities). The gatehouse castellan is a Waterdhavian noble who is appointed by the Masked Lords of Waterdeep and holds the post for a year, beginning on the first day of winter. The current castellan, a boorish twit named Hantanus Tarm (LN male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.XgAjpoJSv5Bqo6gO]{noble}), is responsible for defending the gates but has no military experience. The gatehouse guards report to him, but his position is seen as mostly political and ceremonial, and he has no influence anywhere but at the gatehouse. The gatehouse is spacious enough to accommodate the members of all three shifts, and any attack on the gates brings the full force of the gatehouse staff to bear.</p><p>Merchants and other visitors who come seeking food are rarely turned away, but their wagons and belongings are thoroughly searched in the gatehouse to make sure they contain nothing that could damage crops, such as rodents and vermin. Guests who want to spend the night are directed to Northfurrow's End (@UUID[.0000000000000002#g8.-northfurrows-end]{area G8}).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"G2. Watch Posts\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"201\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">G2. Watch Posts</span></h3> <p>At more or less regular intervals around the perimeter of Goldenfields, the outer wall (which is 60 feet high on the outside and 20 feet high on the inside) widens to accommodate broad stone parapets with buildings atop them. Each parapet features a 30-foot-tall stone pagoda topped by a weather vane. A wooden statue of Chauntea stands in the middle of each pagoda, holding a large bronze gong and surrounded by cornucopias. Next to each pagoda are one or two stone outbuildings that serve as barracks. A 10-foot-wide, moss-covered stone staircase leads from the top of the parapet down to the compound. A set of locked, ironbound wooden doors at ground level provide access to storerooms and cellars located underneath each watch post. Picking a door lock requires thieves' tools and a successful [[/save ability=dex dc=15]] check. The rooms and cellars are packed with harvested fruit and vegetables in the fall and are empty by midwinter.</p><p>The watch posts are crucial to the defense of Goldenfields. Stationed at each post are thirty @UUID[Actor.LTrMewUTBVyx4vkZ]{scouts} (NG males and females of various races and ethnicities) two-thirds of whom are on duty at any given time. The rest are asleep in their bunks. Of the twenty scouts on duty, twelve are stationed on the parapet, spread hundreds of yards apart and looking outward for signs of trouble. The other eight patrol the adjacent walls in pairs.</p><p>The watch posts are far enough apart that shouts of alarm are ineffective. If a watch post needs to sound an alarm, a guard runs to the pagoda and strikes the gong with a heavy mallet. The pagodas are designed to amplify sound, allowing the ringing of each gong to be heard as far as two miles away. Any other watch posts within that range ring their gongs as well, putting more of the compound on alert.</p><p>The watch posts were designed to warn Goldenfields of approaching armies and dragons. Even though the watch posts and the wall patrols provide a great measure of security, a small group of invaders could scale the outer wall and enter the compound undetected if they were lucky enough to avoid the notice of the guards.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"G3.

Earth Mother's Bounty</span></h3> <p>The first thing visitors to Goldenfields see as they pass through the gatehouse is a 20-foot-tall wooden statue of Chauntea, depicted as a plump, smiling woman standing with her hands on her hips in a garden of golden wheat, surrounded by a dirt roundabout. North of the statue is a stone building with an open front, above which hangs a sign that reads \"Earth Mother's Bounty.\" Visitors can buy seeds and cornucopias here. Tasked by the abbot with overseeing the store and its inventory is Sevembra Tumbleleaf (LN female strongheart halfling @UUID[Actor.0j3TeXX8s5hzTAzx]{druid}), a member of the Emerald Enclave who sells nothing but the finest seeds. She also gives away lots of free samples.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"G4.

Livestock Fields</span></h3> <p>On the outskirts of the town are two large fields of roaming oxen and cattle, with cordoned-off pens for @UUID[Actor.Ssu8OtSpU5Fg2r7S]{sheep}, chickens, turkeys, and pigs. Each field is roughly a half-mile in diameter and enclosed by wooden fences with rearing horses carved into their posts. During the day, shepherds as well as workers with milk buckets and wool shears can be seen moving among the herds of cows and @UUID[Actor.Ssu8OtSpU5Fg2r7S]{sheep}.</p><p>One of the new shepherds, @UUID[Actor.DEEgcKqoN6HLLnyP]{Shalvus Martholio} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}), is a Zhentarim spy—a wolf in @UUID[Actor.Ssu8OtSpU5Fg2r7S]{sheep}'s clothing, as it were. His assignment is to determine how easy it would be for the Black Network to gain control of Goldenfields, and report his findings to Nalaskur Thaelond in Bargewright Inn. Shalvus often leaves the livestock pens to hang around Northfurrow's End. He returns to the pens at night to check on the animals.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"G6. Town\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"205\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">G6. Town</span></h3> <p>The buildings that house most of the residents of Goldenfields are arranged in concentric half-rings around a central square where locals can socialize and gather for picnics after midday prayers. Orderly rows of wooden longhouses, each one large enough to house a hundred people, face inward toward a central plaza, with the abbey of Chauntea off to the southeast. Each longhouse is a work of art, its beams sculpted with images of a particular animal, thereby differentiating it from its neighbors. Most of Goldenfields' workers are human @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoners}. A handful of peaceful Chauntea worshipers (NG male and female @UUID[Actor.0j3TeXX8s5hzTAzx]{druids} of various races and ethnicities) live and work among them.</p><p>Wagons and wheelbarrows are parked just about everywhere, free for anyone to use. The oxen needed to pull the wagons are kept in the livestock fields (@UUID[.0000000000000002#g5.-livestock-fields]{area G5}).</p><p>A grove of trees south of town is home to three young @UUID[Actor.qx9gH0Z4iSFmPfNr]{treants}. If the town or the abbey comes under attack, their job is to animate nearby trees and aid in the town's defense. The grove is also home to an awakened tree named @UUID[Actor.rmpqtpkPjIcYXYHe]{Lifferlas} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}). Created by a long-dead druid, @UUID[Actor.rmpqtpkPjIcYXYHe]{Lifferlas} is the oldest living resident of Goldenfields. It speaks Common and has long entertained the children of the workers with harrowing, often humorous tales of heroes and monsters, as well as legends about the gods, Chauntea in particular. The tree allows children to climb it while it walks about cautiously with hosts of them clinging to its boughs and screaming with delight.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"G7. Harvesthome Abbey\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"206\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">G7. Harvesthome Abbey</span></h3> <p>The largest and most elaborate building in Goldenfields is the abbey, Harvesthome, a centuries-old stone edifice whose outer walls have statues of Chauntea at every corner, her hands raised to the sky as though casting a spell to summon rain. Well-tended hedges surround the foundation, and a sun-shaped window of stained glass is set above the entrance and the steps leading up to it. Narrow windows of stained glass decorated with images of wheat, fruit, and vegetables light the pillared arcades within. Toward the back of the building, mounted between sturdy roof beams, is a large bronze bell that is rung fifteen minutes before prayers every morning, noon, and evening.</p><p>Wandering the abbey halls are two old @UUID[Actor.hsVm2g0temWNrr2V]{black bears} named Darlow and Tilbee. A few months ago, they startled some workers in the south fields. No one could fathom how the two bears crept into the compound unseen, spurring rumors that they were gifts from the Earth Mother. Rather than drive them out, the workers sheltered and fed them. The bears eventually followed workers into the abbey. They try to mooch food from visitors while posing no danger to anyone.</p><p>The Abbot of Goldenfields, Ellardin Darovik (NG male Damaran human @UUID[Actor.BSvzE801ExHkxapo]{priest}), is a worshiper of Chauntea and a member of the Emerald Enclave. He's a generous, reserved man who avoids confrontation and doesn't like to ruffle feathers. He leads prayer services at nine bells in the morning, highsun, three bells in the afternoon, and six bells in the evening, and though attendance isn't mandatory, most workers take a break from their chores once a day to hear the abbot's words.</p><p>There are no guards in the abbey, just a handful of acolytes. One of them, @UUID[Actor.40ZyfOY13SUgnEd0]{Zi Liang} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}), has scolded Father Darovik many times for putting the defense of Goldenfields in the hands of incompetent military leaders, which has made her somewhat unpopular. When she isn't busy with chores or prayers, Zi takes it upon herself to patrol the outer walls.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"G8. Northfurrow's End\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"207\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">G8. Northfurrow's End</span></h3> <p>Standing north of the town is a three-story stone edifice with arched windows that offer a view of the surrounding gardens. Thin plumes of smoke issue from its many chimneys on rainy days and cold nights. Life-size statues of rearing horses flank the double doors that lead to the common room. Above these doors hangs a wooden sign that proclaims the name of this grand establishment, Northfurrow's End, in fancy lettering. West of the main building is a stable house that can hold and feed up to fifty horses.</p><p>The proprietor of the inn is an elder member of the Fellowship of Innkeepers guild of Waterdeep and, as such, must operate within the strictures of his guild. His name is @UUID[Actor.h5pvP7sGGVlthjR2]{Miros Xelbrin} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}), and he's a retired carnival attraction—dubbed \"the Yeti\" during his heyday because of his barrel-shaped body and the thick, white hair covering his arms, chest, back, and head.</p><p>Miros is a staunch supporter of the Emerald Enclave and offers free room and board to members of the organization and their companions. His rooms are spacious and comfortable, his food plentiful and delicious (made with only the freshest ingredients). He has little tolerance for rabble-rousers and can spot adventurers from a mile away. Miros employs a staff of twenty cleaners and servers. He sells a local brand of beer called Goldengulp, though the first flagon to a new customer is always free.</p><p>In the back of Northfurrow's End is a pottery kiln that Miros uses to make the inn's trademark flagons. These large, varnished clay mugs have sheaves of golden wheat painted on their sides. Miros doesn't sell these minor works of art, but the mugs are occasionally stolen and sold elsewhere.</p><p>One of the patrons of Northfurrow's End at present is a visitor from Waterdeep. That city's Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors has an agreement with the abbot. Every midwinter, the guild sends one of its members to Goldenfields as a sign of its commitment to protecting Waterdeep's interests. The wizard serves for one year and acts as a liaison between the city and the abbot, while also aiding in the defense of Goldenfields. The guild's current attaché is @UUID[Actor.60wIundZQVnKFKxa]{Naxene Drathkala} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}), a quiet and bookish young woman who lives in a lavishly furnished suite above the inn's stable house and spends most of her time writing papers on subjects both arcane and esoteric. In addition to being a member of the Watchful Order, Naxene is an agent of the Lords' Alliance and a loyal spy for Lady Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep. Miros has tried to court Naxene, but she ignores his halting advances.</p><p>Among the other guests of Northfurrow's End are numerous actors, musicians, acrobats, and other performers from Waterdeep and Daggerford. These spirited folk entertain locals during afternoon picnics in the town circle (@UUID[.0000000000000002#g6.-town]{area G6}). A halfling singer and lute player named @UUID[Actor.OQupPedEBdo3Q62R]{Oren Yogilvy} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016#appendix-d:-special-npcs]{appendix D}) is the only permanent resident of the inn among them. He has a fondness for Goldengulp and gets free room and board for keeping the residents of Goldenfields entertained. After a few drinks, Oren likes to wander the compound in search of inspiration and often wakes up in a field the morning after.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"G9. Goldengulp Brewery\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"208\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">G9. Goldengulp Brewery</span></h3> <p>Goldenfields' brewery is a stately, two-story manse where a beer called Goldengulp is made, using the finest local barley and hops. Visitors aren't allowed in the brewery, which is locked up tight at night. Longhouses in the brewery's front yard are home to the sixty @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoners} who comprise the brewery staff. In the same area is a locked stone warehouse packed to the rafters with casks of Goldengulp. A locked door can be picked open with thieves' tools and a successful [[/save ability=dex dc=15]] check.</p><p>Rising from the back of the brewery is a cylindrical watchtower, known to locals as the Dragon's Spire because a young bronze dragon once perched atop it on a quiet winter afternoon in 1374 DR, the Year of Lightning Storms. The stone tower serves as the headquarters for the Captain of the Guard, who is responsible for Goldenfields' defense. It has its own ground-floor entrance and is four stories tall, with a flat roof enclosed by green marble battlements. Two @UUID[Actor.A8tA2fvXYY2m4iML]{guards} (CG male and female Illuskan humans) stand at the base of the tower, and four more stand watch atop it. The current Captain of the Guard is Strog Thunderblade (NG male half-orc @UUID[Actor.iDlg4HChHwAG5ADN]{veteran}). Boredom and easy access to fine food and beer have made him fat and lackadaisical. He falls asleep early, wakes up late, and leaves the tower once a day around three bells in the afternoon to meet with the abbot and submit a daily report. Strog has a pleasant, easygoing demeanor, and the abbot likes him despite his obvious shortcomings.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"G10.

Now, she tasks her mates with collecting food for her voracious appetite. Two of these big dummies, Lob and Ogg, wandered the hills and valleys south of Grudd Haug, the den of Guh's tribe. They eventually blundered into the Forlorn Hills and, a few weeks ago, stumbled upon a gang of bugbears and goblins. The goblinoids told Lob and Ogg about a large farm on the far side of the Dessarin River. It occurred to the hill giants that they should attack it. So, the giants waded across the river and hurled rocks at Goldenfields, pounding its outer wall and alarming its residents. Archers on the wall retaliated with a barrage of arrows. The giants and goblinoids withdrew to nurse their wounds, leaving Goldenfields' defenders to wonder when the next attack would come. The attack hasn't changed the mood among the residents, who place great stock in the strength of their outer defenses and militia.</p><p>Lob and Ogg spent the next month lost in the hills, trying to find their way back to Grudd Haug. When they got there, they told Guh about the \"big farm.\" Guh dispatched a horde of hill giants, ogres, bugbears, and goblins to pillage it. With Lob and Ogg leading the way, the horde got lost in the hills and blundered into a copper dragon's territory. Many giants, ogres, bugbears, and goblins died that day. The survivors fled, only to stumble into an Uthgardt barbarian ambush. At that point, it became clear to those who remained alive that Lob and Ogg were poor guides and detrimental to the success of the mission. The bugbears took over from there, leading the remnants of the horde to Goldenfields, with Lob and Ogg bringing up the rear and blaming one another for their misadventures.</p><p>The following monsters make it to Goldenfields and participate in the attack:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">Six @UUID[Actor.3TipXibcB2bNDSir]{hill giants}, including Lob and Ogg</li><li class=\"rd__li\">Twelve @UUID[Actor.E5B1fQJu0zWYKjIR]{ogres}, six of them fitted with goblin huckers</li><li class=\"rd__li\">Twelve @UUID[Actor.eWtVflUpmyM1qpSd]{bugbears}</li><li class=\"rd__li\">Sixty @UUID[Actor.FTpa9QcNjUcitQRz]{goblins}, split into two groups of thirty</li></ul><p>All of the bugbears, and half of the ogres and goblins, climb over the walls in the dead of night.

In fact, he never got around to briefing his men or drafting workers or adventurers to help patrol the outer wall, as per the Abbot's instructions.</p><p>Thanks to Strog's lackluster handling of the situation, the ogres, bugbears, and goblins are able to scale the eastern wall at the point marked X on the map and enter the wheat fields (@UUID[.0000000000000002#g13.-wheat-fields]{area G13}) undetected. Once over the wall, they split into three gangs, with two ogres, four bugbears, and ten goblins per gang. The Moon Biters gang reaches the animal pens (@UUID[.0000000000000002#g5.-livestock-fields]{area G5}) at the same time that the Eye Stabbers reach the town (@UUID[.0000000000000002#g6.-town]{area G6}). The Hill Howlers get lost in the wheat field and emerge near a random cluster of grain towers (@UUID[.0000000000000002#g4.-grain-towers]{area G4}). Once they realize their mistake, they head back into the field and make their way toward the abbey (@UUID[.0000000000000002#g7.-harvesthome-abbey]{area G7}). @UUID[Actor.OQupPedEBdo3Q62R]{Oren Yogilvy} spots the Eye Stabbers while wandering through town, half-drunk, mulling over lyrics for a new song.

How the players run their NPCs during the battle is up to them, but encourage the players to review their NPCs' ideals, bonds, and flaws. All of these NPCs are familiar with Goldenfields' defenses and can run to get help, if that's what the players want them to do. For more information on how to use and run these NPCs, see the \"Special NPCs\" section at the start of this chapter. If the players try to keep the special NPCs out of the fight, you can endanger them by having one or more groups of monsters threaten the NPCs directly, thereby requiring the player-controlled NPCs to act.</p><p>Each gang of monsters is a separate encounter. If the abbey's bell hasn't been rung by the time the second gang of goblinoids is defeated, the abbot rings it. (It takes time for the abbot to realize something is amiss and reach the bell in the dead of night.) The ringing bell can be heard for miles and puts all of Goldenfields' defenses on alert. The bell panics any ogres, bugbears, and goblins that are still inside the compound, and they flee back toward the wall.</p><p>During this time, inexplicably, Lob and Ogg decide to climb over the wall and enter the compound rather than flee, while the other four hill giants regroup with the ogres and goblins lurking outside Goldenfields. The giants leave behind their greatclubs, since they can't climb the walls with their clubs in hand. A handful of guards confront the two foolish giants, but they retreat once Lob and Ogg start breaking off and hurling wall battlements (treat as hurled rocks). The two giants eventually make their way toward the abbey (@UUID[.0000000000000002#g7.-harvesthome-abbey]{area G7}). If either giant is reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, he surrenders (see \"Development\").</p><p>If forced into melee combat, an unarmed hill giant can use its action to make two unarmed attacks. Replace the giant's greatclub attack with the following attack option:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"></span></span><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Unarmed Attack\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"223\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Unarmed Attack.</span></span> <i>Melee Weapon Attack</i>: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <i>Hit</i>: 12 ([[/r 3d4 + 5]]) bludgeoning damage.</p></div></div><p>After the characters deal with the threats inside the walls, townsfolk emerge from their longhouses and begin to scour the fields for stray threats. Characters who join the search find trails that lead back to the wall. By this time, the sky to the east has lightened enough to reveal the presence of giants, ogres, and goblins outside the wall. The invaders close to within 120 feet of the wall and begin hurling rocks and goblins.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Goblin Huckers\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"224\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goblin Huckers</span></h3> <p>The six ogres that remain outside Goldenfields wear hobgoblin inventions called goblin huckers. Each of these contraptions is essentially a portable trebuchet strapped to a leather harness. The contraption rests on an ogre's back and shoulders, and despite its cumbersome appearance, it doesn't inhibit the wearer's mobility or fighting ability. It takes 10 minutes for someone else to attach or remove the elaborate harness, or [[/r 1d6]] hours if an ogre attempts to do so unassisted. The contraption is built for ogres specifically. A dwarf or similarly built humanoid that is magically transformed to Large size can don or doff a goblin hucker in 10 minutes.</p><p>The sling of the trebuchet is big enough to hurl a rock, a flaming cask of pitch, or a similarly sized projectile—but the contraption was designed to fling goblins. A goblin used as a projectile typically wears a spiked helmet, so that it deals piercing damage to the target on impact. The thirty goblins outside Goldenfields are equipped with helmets. A goblin rarely survives the experience of being hurled through the air in this fashion. The goblins here stand ready to be flung at enemies on the wall, while the ogres position themselves 300 feet away from their targets.</p><p>The wearer of a goblin hucker launches its payload in a high arc, so it can hit targets behind cover. Loading the sling is an action that the contraption's wearer can't perform. A goblin willing to serve as a living projectile can load itself, if necessary. The ogre must then use an action to aim the weapon and pull the cord that releases the sling and hurls the projectile through the air.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"></span></span><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Goblin Projectile\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"225\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goblin Projectile.</span></span> <i>Ranged Weapon Attack</i>: +3 to hit, range 150/600 ft.

Those that escape rejoin their comrades waiting outside the wall. Lob and Ogg are the exceptions; more afraid of Guh than of the Goldenfields defenders, they hate the thought of returning to their chief without a mountain of food. But neither giant wants to die, and each surrenders if reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, falling to the ground and beginning to sob like a big baby. If questioned, Lob or Ogg responds by blubbering incoherently. A successful [[/save ability=cha dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Intimidation]) check pries the following information out of a defeated but conscious hill giant:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">\"Guh want food.\"</li><li class=\"rd__li\">\"Me get food for Guh.\"</li><li class=\"rd__li\">\"Guh big. Real big. Bigger than me.\"</li><li class=\"rd__li\">\"Grudd Haug. Home.\"</li></ul><p>Characters who successfully intimidate one or both giants can command them to lead the way to Grudd Haug. But because neither giant has a good sense of direction, any such expedition is doomed. The hill giants become disoriented while leading the party into the Forlorn Hills east of Goldenfields. Stupid beyond belief, Lob and Ogg are unable to find their way back to Grudd Haug no matter how strongly the characters motivate them.</p><p>Captured monsters that are left to the tender mercies of the Goldenfields defenders are put to death, by order of Captain Strog Thunderblade. The captain then takes credit for defeating the monstrous horde that attacked Goldenfields. The abbot, being much more sensible, thanks the adventurers profusely and makes sure they're cited for their heroics and well supplied when the time comes for them to leave. If the characters call for Strog's resignation, the abbot vows to give their recommendation serious thought.</p><p>Whether or not the characters thwart the attack on Goldenfields, they gain special quests and rewards based on which NPCs survived the battle.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Goldenfields Quests\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"228\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goldenfields Quests</span></h2> <p>For each special NPC who survives the attack on Goldenfields, the party receives a quest and gains a particular reward for completing that quest.

Grateful for their assistance, Nalaskur offers the characters a warm dinner and clean beds for the night, free of charge. The next morning, he asks the characters to accompany a beer wagon to the Troll in Flames, a tavern in the village of Mornbryn's Shield. Two @UUID[Actor.WRk4ZaTojWM7mBXf]{draft horses} pull the wagon, which has a pair of drivers named Jostin and Lessilar (N male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.dleF6z2lXhdoBTLV]{thugs}). They take turns at the reins.</p><p>If the delivery is made, the characters pass Nalaskur's test. Unless they do something to turn the Black Network against them, the characters receive an anonymous bundle from the Zhentarim the next time they visit Bargewright Inn, Everlund, Mirabar, Silverymoon, Neverwinter, Waterdeep, or Yartar (all of which have a strong Zhentarim presence). The bundle contains a block of excellent cheese wrapped in silk, a black bottle of \"Old Bargewright\" wine, and a folded piece of parchment on which are written the following words:</p><p><i>Zira</i></p><p><i>The Happy Cow</i></p><p><i>Daggerford</i></p><p>Any character who has spent time in Daggerford can, with a successful [[/save ability=int dc=10]] check, recall that the Happy Cow is a halfling-run tavern in town.

When they call in the favor, Zira does her best to help them, though she will not cause direct harm to others or violate local laws. She tries to hide the fact that she's a dragon, but if the characters need swift transportation to some far-flung destination, she offers to fly them there.

The awakened tree tells them that Aerglas was not only a member of the Emerald Enclave but also an adventurer who slew many giants in his day. Aerglas left Goldenfields thirty years ago on a pilgrimage to Shadowtop Cathedral (see chapter 3). The druid planned to follow the Dessarin River and seek out an old treant named @UUID[Actor.X6t7Q0uBOQmXFSU5]{Turlang}. @UUID[Actor.rmpqtpkPjIcYXYHe]{Lifferlas} suggests that the characters do the same.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.X6t7Q0uBOQmXFSU5]{Turlang} isn't at Shadowtop Cathedral when the characters arrive, but a morose @UUID[Actor.faDJzz03SxMZqkun]{satyr} named Greenwhistle assures them that the treant \"will be along any time now.\" Greenwhistle is disappointed because a dryad spurned his advances, so he sits by a pool playing sad songs on his panpipes day and night. Between songs, Greenwhistle repeatedly assures the characters that @UUID[Actor.X6t7Q0uBOQmXFSU5]{Turlang} \"will be along any time now.\" The treant arrives on the third night after the characters arrive, in the company of a friend named Tharra Shyndle (NG female half-elf @UUID[Actor.0j3TeXX8s5hzTAzx]{druid}), who is a member of the Emerald Enclave.</p><p>The treant is initially indifferent toward the heroes and not of a mind to please. If one or more characters approach the treant in a nonthreatening manner and initiates a conversation, Tharra urges the treant not to lose its temper. The treant groans audibly and answers brusquely. It doesn't know @UUID[Actor.rmpqtpkPjIcYXYHe]{Lifferlas} but remembers Aerglas fondly. The treant hasn't seen the druid in many years and doesn't know where Aerglas can be found. If the characters reveal their opposition to the giants, @UUID[Actor.X6t7Q0uBOQmXFSU5]{Turlang} offers them help in the form of two @UUID[Actor.xkhzY1YB2JIlHtmK]{awakened trees} and one @UUID[Actor.KVvZJKFLc7LbksKQ]{awakened shrub}.

If they accept, they have no hostile encounters en route. Once they reach the forest's edge, Tharra makes a decision whether to befriend the characters or not. If they seem friendly and show concern for the fate of the natural world, she declares her friendship by giving them a pouch of [[/r 1d4 + 4]] magical silver berries that she picked near the Lost Peaks. Swallowing a berry has the same effect as imbibing a @UUID[Item.ZHErTl3CtPCa222M]{potion of invisibility}.

If she's friendly toward the characters, she invites them to join her, saying she could use the company. If the characters accept the invitation, Tharra leads them to Everlund, then east to Jalanthar by way of the Rauvin Road.

He has been entrusted with some items that once belonged to Zi's parents, and though Zi is now old enough to have them, she has no immediate need of them and prefers an ascetic lifestyle. If the characters show Cauldar the pendant, he understands that Zi has bequeathed her inheritance to them. He sends servants to the attic to retrieve an old wooden trunk and bring it to the characters, then unlocks it with a key and lets them claim the two magic items inside.

The two performed together in a traveling carnival troupe many years ago.</p><p>If the characters make the effort to get to know Arleosa and reveal that they're adventurers, Arleosa playfully recalls that she captivated a few adventurous admirers in her day. One of them, Arleosa says, was so enchanted with her that he gave her a wooden ring adorned with dancing nymphs and told her that it represented a special favor. Should she need anything, all she must do is whisper his name (\"Keltar Dardragon\") into the ring, and he would appear and provide assistance. She never found the need to do so, but she offers the ring to the character she likes the most (as determined by you).

The ring loses its magical property once the apparition appears. Nothing can alter Keltar's cheery demeanor. The dead halfling points them in the direction of an old tower in the wilderness, claiming (in Common) that they'll find useful items hidden inside it.

Naxene is convinced that now is not the time for half-measures. She has read books about the ancient conflict between dragons and giants, and she urges the characters to seek out a powerful good dragon, convince it to contact other good dragons, and use them to combat the giants. Naxene is confident that the Lords' Alliance will support this plan, given the gravity of the situation. She couldn't be more wrong.</p><p>Naxene is unaware that the Lords' Alliance leaders would rather hurl themselves into the Nine Hells than deal with dragons. She recommends that the party speak to an acquaintance of hers—a \"dragon expert\" in Waterdeep named Chazlauth Yarghorn (CN male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.sMYXCW2K2ptMY1Wb]{mage}).

He suggests that the characters travel to the Kryptgarden Forest and seek out Old Gnawbone, a powerful and eccentric green dragon rumored to possess a collection of <i>crystal balls</i> that she uses to scry on everyone and everything. Based on what Chazlauth knows about green dragons, and Old Gnawbone in particular, he doesn't think the dragon will harm the characters if they seem intent on ending the giant threat, and he's willing to risk their lives to test his theory.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Treasure\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"239\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure.</span></span> If the characters agree to seek out Old Gnawbone, Chazlauth plucks a handful of potions from a shelf in his tower and gives one to each character.

The real family business, however, is moneylending.

Nearly half of Triboar's population lives outside the town proper, on sprawling ranches and neighboring farmsteads, most of which lie to the north or east.</p><p>The current lord protector of Triboar is a good-natured Harper and ex-adventurer named @UUID[Actor.x6l8UhMHBKRYb6EI]{Darathra Shendrel}. Darathra enacts and modifies local laws (known as \"the Lord's Decree\"), which are then enforced by the Twelve—a squad of a dozen mounted warriors drawn from the militia.</p><p>Triboar is a market for the horses raised by nearby ranches. Blacksmiths, harness-makers, and wagonworks also flourish in town. In addition, a number of guides operate out of Triboar.

Urlam is rarely seen without his suave bodyguard, Valken Naspeer (N male half-elf @UUID[Actor.M8U97ZHHUCo57VXi]{assassin}).

Urgala has three @UUID[Actor.MySun3qorBU5FDbH]{mastiffs} (hunting dogs) that sleep in the ground floor common room, and she employs a staff of six loyal, well-paid @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoners} (LG males and females of various races and ethnicities).

Part of the roof caught fire two summers ago and has yet to be repaired. The holes in the roof have allowed birds to build nests among the beams, and the floor and tables are speckled with bird droppings. The Troll's one redeeming feature is its large, well-stocked cellar. The owner and proprietor of the Troll is a struggling actor named Kaelen Sarssir (LN male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}). He \"inherited\" the tavern after the previous owner fled in the wake of a scandal and has done the minimum amount of work necessary to keep it operational. Kaelen has dreams of turning the Troll into a theater, but he lacks the funds and the ambition to do so.

A year ago, Ghelryn made splendid suits of ceremonial armor for King Morinn and Queen Tithmel of Citadel Felbarr, and the royals were so impressed that they bestowed upon Ghelryn the honorary title of Royal Armorer. For that and other reasons, the Foehammer name is synonymous with top-quality goods throughout the Dessarin Valley, and Ghelryn intends to keep it that way.</p><p>Ghelryn hates orcs and giants.

The inn itself is a beautiful stone building with lamps hanging from its eaves and a turret in one corner.</p><p>The snobbery of Everwyvern House is equaled by its elegant foppery. The atmosphere in the place is like a parody of the grandest Waterdhavian noble parties. Folk come here to be awed by it, to be amused by it, or to feel at home in it. Minstrels play quiet background music among floating plants and many-hued driftglobes, while startlingly gowned women and dashingly sashed and ruffled men chat, stroll, dance, and sneer at each other. Several of these well-dressed fops are actually escorts (N male and female human @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoners} of various ethnicities) employed by the inn's proprietor to enhance the mood.

The Everwyvern's beds are comfortable but horribly overpriced (15 gp per night), though the fee includes room service and companionship, if desired. The meals on the menu are prepared just as they are in Waterdeep's finest restaurants, but nonetheless they are extraordinarily expensive (25 gp per plate).

Narth also lets the characters keep Boris and the cart once they complete the delivery.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Development\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"288\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Development.</span></span> When the characters arrive at Noanar's Hold, they are told that they can find Amrath Mulnobar in the keep overlooking the village. Amrath takes the harnesses off their hands without so much as a thank-you. Thus ends the quest.</p><p>With no other settlements nearby, the characters might be inclined to spend the night in the White Hart Inn, where they meet three middle-aged brothers from Neverwinter (LE male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.XgAjpoJSv5Bqo6gO]{nobles}) who are gearing up for a hunt. Their names are Rantharl, Marthun, and Lezryk Daerivoss, and they tell the characters that they've come to Noanar's Hold to hunt hill giants. The brothers don't want company. They quietly saddle their horses, strap on their rapiers, and ride out at dawn. The younger brothers return before dusk, but Rantharl is not with them, and Marthun has a laceration on his right shoulder that a successful [[/save ability=wis dc=11]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Medicine]) check confirms is a rapier wound.</p><p>If pressed, the brothers claim that a hill giant killed Rantharl. Marthun claims that he was struck by the giant's spiked greatclub and denies any assertion that his wound was caused by a rapier. A successful [[/save ability=wis dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Insight]) check confirms that Marthun and Lezryk are lying, though Marthun welcomes any healing that the characters can provide.</p><p>The brothers are playing a murderous game with their inheritances at stake. The agreement was simple: the brother who first deals the killing blow to a hill giant would gain the inheritances of the other two. Rantharl won the contest, but Marthun and Lezryk turned against him. A fight ensued, Marthun was wounded, and Rantharl died. With Rantharl gone and no clear winner, Marthun and Lezryk have agreed to track down another hill giant.</p><p>If the characters follow the brothers on their hunt and are spotted, the brothers attack them. If the characters do nothing, Marthun and Lezryk begin another hunt the following day, but they encounter no hill giants. Lezryk betrays and kills Marthun, then returns to the inn to rest before making the long trip back to Neverwinter to deliver the sad news of his brothers' untimely deaths at the hands of \"rampaging hill giants.\" Characters can blackmail Lezryk for a cut of the brothers' inheritance (worth 10,000 gp total), or deal with the treacherous cad in some other manner as they see fit.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Urgala Meltimer's Quest\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"289\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Urgala Meltimer's Quest</span></h3> <p>In the aftermath of the battle, @UUID[Actor.wny8Lm5HRUXe7g1b]{Urgala} relates to the characters that one of her former adventuring companions, a wealthy knight named Harthos Zymorven, had a @UUID[Item.aWjTwEX1FXrL7ooc]{giant slayer greatsword}. (Change the weapon to a @UUID[Item.6vWSp0hkOj35KfzE]{giant slayer greataxe} if that would be more desirable to a party member.) The last time Urgala spoke with him, Harthos was living in Zymorven Hall, his ancestral keep on the Rauvin Road northwest of Silverymoon. Urgala thinks Harthos might be willing to part with the weapon if the characters mention her name to him and explain their reason for needing it.</p><p>If the characters journey to Zymorven Hall, they find Lord Harthos Zymorven, but he is sad to report that his son Harthal has stolen the @UUID[Item.fW6wuZxKdEpLc3Y9]{giant slayer}. Harthal committed this act after Lord Zymorven disowned him for marrying a common thief from Yartar (whose name he doesn't recall). What Harthal did with the sword, Lord Zymorven can only imagine.</p><p>The characters can travel to Yartar and search for Harthal there. After a few polite inquiries, it becomes apparent that the local thieves' guild, the Hand of Yartar, might be their best hope of finding Harthal. A character can bribe a tavern server at the Wink and Kiss (5 gp is sufficient) to learn the identity and whereabouts of a known Hand of Yartar member. They're as common as rats. If the characters obtained a letter of recommendation from Tamalin Zoar (see the \"Calling Horns\" section in chapter 3), they can show it to the Hand of Yartar member, who promises to have the information they need in a few hours. Otherwise, the thief demands a 500 gp payment up front. When the thief returns [[/r 1d6]] hours later, she tells the characters that Harthal was arrested and imprisoned for murdering a man, and the greatsword found its way into the hands of a corrupt watch captain named Tholzar Brenner (LE male Damaran human @UUID[Actor.JjLaza8KBv8kODS5]{knight}).</p><p>The characters can try to relieve Brenner of the weapon by force. The man has many enemies, so he usually travels with eight @UUID[Actor.A8tA2fvXYY2m4iML]{guards} (LE male and female humans of various ethnicities). He refuses to relinquish the weapon willingly. Under normal circumstances, the death or disappearance of a watch member would trigger an investigation, but in Captain Brenner's case, Waterbaron Nestra Ruthiol is happy to be rid of him and doesn't order one.</p><p>Any character who belongs to the Harpers or the Zhentarim can approach his or her faction for help. If the character succeeds on a [[/save ability=int dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Investigation]) check, he or she locates a faction safe house and gains entry. A failed check can be rerolled after another day spent searching, until a check succeeds or the character gives up the search. Inside the safe house, the character meets a faction representative, who sets a few wheels in motion. A few hours later, the stolen weapon is delivered to the safe house.</p><p>A character who belongs to the Lords' Alliance can petition the Waterbaron for help. The character must succeed on a [[/save ability=cha dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Deception] or &amp;Reference[skill=Persuasion]) check to gain an audience. &amp;Reference[skill=Deception] is appropriate if the character makes false claims to gain an audience; otherwise, use &amp;Reference[skill=Persuasion]. A failed check can be rerolled the next day, but each failed check increases the DC by 1. If a character succeeds on this check, the Waterbaron wrests the sword from Captain Brenner's clutches and sees it delivered safely to that individual.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Treasure\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"290\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure.</span></span> Lord Zymorven's weapon is indeed a @UUID[Item.fW6wuZxKdEpLc3Y9]{giant slayer} greatsword (or greataxe).</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Othovir's Quest\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"291\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Othovir's Quest</span></h3> <p>After his close call during the giants' attack, @UUID[Actor.oulpczeoV2iqH36M]{Othovir} expresses his gratitude to the characters by sharing a secret with them: he knows the location of a stash of magic items that the Margaster family, his kin, keeps locked away for emergencies. If the characters ask him how he came by this information, @UUID[Actor.oulpczeoV2iqH36M]{Othovir} tells them that he has a history with the Margaster family, which he despises for reasons he'd rather not discuss. The family owns a three-story tower in Silverymoon that has a detached carriage house on the property, and it is here that the characters must travel. He provides the following details:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">The carriage house is a 30-foot-square stone building with two floors. The windowless ground floor that holds the carriage has a big wooden sliding door in the front.

The cambions are loyal to House Margaster and attack anyone they catch infiltrating the carriage house.</p><p>The @spell[alarm] spell not only attracts the cambions but also alerts Xamlyn Margaster (LE female Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.sMYXCW2K2ptMY1Wb]{mage}), who lives in the nearby tower.

As it turns out, giants are everywhere and wreaking all sorts of havoc, from the Sword Coast to the desert of Anauroch. This chapter describes this setting, beginning with an overview of the Savage Frontier and some of its key inhabitants, then presenting descriptions of specific locations. The chapter concludes with three encounters that help propel the story forward:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">In the \"@UUID[.0000000000000003#old-tower]{Old Tower}\" section, adventurers meet a lonely hill giant with an axe to grind;</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The \"@UUID[.0000000000000003#inner-circles]{Inner Circles}\" section describes a series of teleportation circles that the adventurers can use to expedite travel;</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The \"@UUID[.0000000000000003#harshnag]{Harshnag}\" section introduces adventurers to a frost giant who means to help them.</li></ul><p>Until the characters find a more expeditious means of transportation, they will be doing a lot of overland traveling. <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,5\">Chapter 5</a> of the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a> provides advice and tools to help make wilderness travel fun for you and the players, as well as rules for foraging and becoming lost. You can use the travel-montage approach or the hour-by-hour approach, or you can experiment with both to see which approach works best for you. That chapter also includes a table to randomly determine the weather and a table of random urban encounters (useful when the adventurers arrive at a city).</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Peoples of the North\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"297\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Peoples of the North</span></h1> <p>The Savage Frontier, or the North, is a harsh and untamed wilderness dotted with fortified settlements and the lairs of terrible monsters. In hundreds of bloodcurdling tales of danger and hardship, the North is portrayed as a vast, cold, and lawless domain that defies all attempts to civilize it. Grim dwarfholds, tribes of fierce barbarians, and half-legendary elf realms might stand for a short time, but none are destined to last. An orc horde or a flight of dragons could sweep them all away tomorrow, leaving nothing but mile upon unmapped mile of wilderness.</p><p>The Savage Frontier lies between the Sword Coast and the desert of Anauroch, extending as far north as Icewind Dale and as far south as the city of Waterdeep. The denizens of the North are accustomed to cool, mild summers and fierce, bitter winters. Beacons of civilization hug the Sword Coast and dot the fertile river valleys, yet despite the abundant natural resources and scenic beauty, survival is a day-to-day concern for the people who live here.</p><p>The North is a land of great mineral wealth and seemingly limitless stands of timber. Here, too, can be found the wealth of history—the plunder of lost civilizations such as Illefarn and Eaerlann, the ancient kingdoms of the gold elves; Delzoun, a long-buried nation of dungeon-dwelling dwarves; and Netheril, a fallen empire of human spellcasters. Throughout the Savage Frontier lie the ruins and dungeons of these and other \"forgotten realms.\" Cities such as Waterdeep, Mirabar, and Neverwinter would like to claim this wealth and knowledge for themselves, but enforcing such claims is next to impossible. The cities have a hard enough time protecting their farmlands and roads from brigands and monsters.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Civilized Folk\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"298\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Civilized Folk</span></h2> <p>Humans are the most widespread of the civilized races, but no unified human nation exists in the North—only individual cities, towns, villages, fiefdoms, farmsteads, fortresses, and outposts connected to one another by long, mostly unprotected rivers and roads. Human settlements rely on various industries for survival. For example, most of the humans of Ten-Towns and Port Llast are fishers, the humans of Mirabar and Leilon are primarily miners, and the humans who live in Beliard, Triboar, and other settlements of the central Dessarin Valley are mostly farmers. Coastal cities such as Waterdeep, Luskan, and Neverwinter—as well as riverside cities such as Yartar, Everlund, and Silverymoon—are home to human traders, shipbuilders, and artisans.</p><p>Although each city of the North enjoys and maintains its independence, all these communities are at risk of being overrun by the monstrous threats that live outside their walls. Fear of the wilderness and its many terrors led to the formation of the Lords' Alliance, a loose confederacy of human-dominated settlements built on mutually beneficial trade agreements and a willingness to seek out and destroy threats to civilization. Members of the Lords' Alliance include the cities of Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Mirabar, Yartar, and Silverymoon, as well as the towns of Amphail, Daggerford, and Longsaddle and the dwarfhold of Mithral Hall. Baldur's Gate, a city hundreds of miles to the south, is also a member.</p><p>Within the settlements of the North, one can find humans, dwarves, elves, and other civilized races commingling more or less peacefully. Waterdeep, in particular, is a melting pot of races from all over Faerûn. Outside these communities, however, people have much less tolerance for other races, as folk tend to feel safer among their own kind. Small towns and villages dominated by humans tend to have few if any nonhumans, with most dwarves, elves, and halflings preferring to live in their own settlements, far from human-claimed lands. In generations past, most human settlers of the North were fair-haired and light-skinned. Since then, the riches and promise of the Savage Frontier have attracted distant foreigners, and several generations of cultural intermingling have given the humans of the North much more diversity in their appearance (see \"@race[human||Human Names and Ethnicities]\" in <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,1\">chapter 2</a> of the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a>).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Northlanders\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"299\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Northlanders</span></h2> <p>The terms Northlander, Northfolk, and Northmen are interchangeable. They refer to one of several tall, fair-haired, seagoing peoples that ply the cold northern waters and dwell on the islands of the west, including Tuern, Gundarlun, Ruathym, the Purple Rocks, and the Korinn Archipelago. Northfolk ancestors built small villages along the Sword Coast that have since become cities, including fabled Illusk (now Luskan), Eigersstor (now Neverwinter), and Nimoar's Hold (now Waterdeep). These early Northlanders farmed the rocky coastlines, fished coastal waters, and hunted seals and whales on the open sea. A few clans of Northlanders explored the monster-infested interior of the Savage Frontier, and they became the ancestors of the Uthgardt tribes and the present-day denizens of Icewind Dale.</p><p>Northlanders farm, fish, and mine their rugged lands, then shrewdly trade their goods with foreign buyers. Many once-feared tribes have become merchants whose bartering skills are equal to or better than the warlike talents of their ancestors, such that many a Northlander merchant is wealthier than their raiding neighbors.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Reghed Nomads\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"300\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Reghed Nomads</span></h2> <p>The frozen tundra of Icewind Dale is home to the nomadic Reghed barbarians. They are named after the Reghed Glacier that forms a towering ice wall along the eastern boundary of their domain. Markedly taller than most southerners, with some males approaching seven feet in height, Reghed barbarians have blue eyes and hair of blond, red, or light brown. Their skin is bronzed from the sun and cracked by the wind, giving their faces the look of tough leather set in an expressionless mask. They dress in leather and furs. At one time, scores of Reghed tribes roamed the frozen north. Now, due to wars with orcs and battles against their own kind, not to mention the encroachment of civilization, only four Reghed tribes remain. They follow herds of reindeer on the animals' annual migrations, moving southwest in the winter and northeast in the summer. The barbarians live in large, round tents made of deerskin and supported by beams of wood or whalebone.</p><p>In the past, the Reghed tribes were known to raid Ten-Towns for supplies, but now the Tribe of the Elk is learning to live in peace with the more civilized people of Ten-Towns. The other three Reghed tribes—the Tribe of the Tiger, the Tribe of the Wolf, and the Tribe of the Bear—are more likely to attack one another than to threaten their more civilized neighbors, fighting over sustenance at the risk of their own extinction.</p><p>A single Reghed tribe is made up of small clans scattered throughout Icewind Dale, each with its own chieftain. The chieftains choose the most powerful among them to be their king or queen—the one around whom others rally in times of crisis. When a monarch dies, the tribe's chieftains gather to choose a new one. Disputes over who should be named king or queen are resolved through trials by nonlethal combat. Without a unifying leader, a Reghed tribe is more fractured and vulnerable to its enemies. Thus, chieftains are motivated to name one among them who rules above all. A chieftain who becomes king or queen wears that mantle for life.</p><p>Reghed barbarians hate orcs, and the Tribes of the Bear, the Elk, and the Tiger will set aside tribal rivalries to destroy them. These tribes will also unite against white dragons and frost giants, since those creatures threaten Icewind Dale's food supply. The Tribe of the Wolf and its mad king, Isarr Kronenstrom, don't ally with the other tribes—they are so vicious and bloodthirsty as to be unapproachable. The kings and queens of the other tribes would see the Tribe of the Wolf obliterated, but the Wolf King and his followers are adept at avoiding the traps set for them by their rivals.</p><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/025-skt03-02.webp\"/>\n</div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Tribe of the Bear\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"301\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tribe of the Bear</span></h3> <p>One of the Bear tribe's two remaining chieftains, Wolvig Barrundson, recently fell under the sway of evil and formed an alliance with a supernatural entity known as the Ice Witch. Her demise also spelled Wolvig's doom, allowing the sole remaining chieftain, Gunvald Halraggson, to declare himself the Bear King. He tries to be honorable, but he is without mercy and doesn't change his mind easily. He has trouble relating to Ten-Towners and other civilized folk, so he tries to avoid them.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Tribe of the Elk\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"302\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tribe of the Elk</span></h3> <p>For the most part, the Tribe of the Elk lives in peace with the Ten-Towners. King Jarund Elkhardt, a towering figure, rules his people with wisdom and care. He has seen other kings rise and fall, has made war with his friends and peace with his enemies, and has led warriors he knew as babes to their deaths in battle. The strain of his long years is written on his face.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Tribe of the Tiger\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"303\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tribe of the Tiger</span></h3> <p>It is unusual for a woman to lead a Reghed tribe, but Bjornhild Solvigsdottir is no ordinary woman. The fearless wife of King Korold, she fought alongside him in many battles. After a frost giant slew Korold, the formidable Bjornhild took his place. Bjornhild worships Auril the Frostmaiden and is so ruthless that her enemies believe she has actual ice flowing through her veins.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Tribe of the Wolf\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"304\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tribe of the Wolf</span></h3> <p>Weakened by conflict, the Tribe of the Wolf was without a king or queen for three winters. Its most powerful chieftain, Isarr Kronenstrom, is a bloodthirsty tyrant who worships Malar the Beast-Lord. He hunts Ten-Towners for sport and strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies, many of whom believe he's the Chosen of Malar. Several members of Isarr's clan have deserted him or been killed off by rival tribes, but the few that remain are fiercely loyal, Though Isarr's clan has dwindled in recent years, the other Wolf chieftains fear Isarr and are too weak to challenge him. They are also afraid to ally with the other Reghed tribes against Isarr. Although Isarr calls himself the Wolf King, few others in the Wolf tribe support him in that claim.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Uthgardt\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"305\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Uthgardt</span></h2> <p>The Uthgardt are a black-haired and blue-eyed people—large, hale, territorial folk who don't trust outsiders. Few Uthgardt are willing to trade with non-Uthgardt settlements. Many are raiders who pillage and destroy any caravan or homestead they come across.</p><p>Uthgardt barbarians take their name from Uthgar Gardolfsson, a great hero-chief who battled giants and conquered much of the North before ascending to godhood. In addition to revering Uthgar, each tribe venerates a totem animal spirit after which the tribe is named.</p><p>Numerous Uthgardt tribes have been vanquished over the years, and at least one tribe previously thought to be extinct has returned in force. There are currently eleven known Uthgardt tribes scattered throughout the North. Each tribe claims a vast tract of wilderness as its hunting grounds—territory that often overlaps with the hunting grounds of other Uthgardt tribes as well as land claimed by civilized races, orcs, dragons, goblinoids, and other monsters. Encounters with Uthgardt barbarians can occur almost anywhere in the Savage Frontier.</p><p>Uthgardt speak their own language (called Bothii), which has no alphabet. Each tribe is made up of several widely scattered clans, each with its own chieftain and tribal shaman. The chieftains of a particular tribe choose one among them to become the great chief of the tribe, with power comparable to a monarch.</p><p>Uthgardt barbarians bury their dead under cairns and earthen mounds. These burial sites are scattered throughout the North in out-of-the-way places. Each Uthgardt tribe also has a single spirit mound that is sacred to its people. A spirit mound is where members of the tribe gather to revere Uthgar, honor their ancestors, make sacrifices to their totem animal spirit, and choose a new great chief when the old one dies. The Uthgardt believe that their ancestors trapped their totem spirits under these mounds so that they and their descendants could commune with the spirits and gain their power.</p><p>Uthgardt barbarians fear magic so much that they will attempt to kill and dismember spellcasters they meet. Tribal shamans are not attacked because their power comes from the spirits of their dead ancestors. (See @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000015]{appendix C} for more information on Uthgardt shamans.)</p><p>Uthgardt hunt and forage for food. With one notable exception among the tribes, they don't build houses or permanent settlements, preferring a nomadic lifestyle.</p><p>Of all their enemies, Uthgardt barbarians hate orcs most of all. Even rival tribes will unite against a rampaging orc horde. The Uthgardt treat giants with similar contempt—the legends of the barbarians are replete with tales of how evil giants slew their ancestors and threatened Uthgar's rise to godhood.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Black Lion Tribe\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"306\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Black Lion Tribe</span></h3> <p>The Black Lion tribe prowls the northern Silver Marches and the Druarwood, protecting its spirit mound at Beorunna's Well (which it shares with the Red Tiger tribe). The Black Lions have been known to raid poorly defended homesteads for food and supplies during harsh winters. The great chief of the Black Lion tribe, Stellok Kolraavi, wears armor made from orc hide and has a fearsome reputation. His younger sister, Tysis Kolraavi, is a shaman and Stellok's only trusted advisor. The siblings venerate Uthgar, and they have no tolerance for diplomacy or for the trappings of civilization.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Black Raven Tribe\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"307\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Black Raven Tribe</span></h3> <p>The Black Ravens claim the icy foothills west of Mirabar, as well as the Ice Lakes and the land west to the Frozenfar. They like to prey on caravans that travel the Northern Means and the Blackford Road. Black Raven warriors often ride giant ravens (use the @UUID[Actor.Nu1WLtI5fRKhHU5r]{giant vulture} statistics) into battle. The Black Ravens share their spirit mound at Raven Rock with the Gray Wolf tribe. The great chief of the Black Raven tribe is Ojin Voninsdottir, a cold, heartless woman with an orc-skull helm.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Blue Bear Tribe\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"308\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Blue Bear Tribe</span></h3> <p>The easternmost of the Uthgardt tribes, the Blue Bear tribe was thought destroyed more than a century ago. Recently, clans haunting the High Forest have emerged and begun to spread throughout Delimbiyr Vale, from the Nether Mountains to the northern edge of the High Moor—territory unclaimed by their Uthgardt rivals. The Blue Bears are careful to stay hidden when traveling to and from their spirit mound at Stone Stand, preserving the myth that they are extinct. The tribe's great chief is a canny old woman named Kriga Moonmusk, who travels in a fur-draped chair carried by four tribal warriors.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Elk Tribe\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"309\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Elk Tribe</span></h3> <p>The Elk tribe (no relation to the Reghed barbarians' Tribe of the Elk) wanders the Evermoors and the land north of the Dessarin River, between Yartar and Noanar's Hold. The Elk barbarians shun civilization. Their spirit mound is a rocky tor in the southeastern Surbrin Hills called Flint Rock. The Elk tribe's great chief is Rond Vaarson, an old, battle-hardened warrior who has spilled so much blood that he no longer craves it. Younger chieftains are waiting for him to die so that they can vie for the honor of being his successor, but Rond doesn't plan on leaving this world anytime soon.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Gray Wolf Tribe\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"310\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gray Wolf Tribe</span></h3> <p>The Gray Wolf barbarians are murderous werewolves, which roam in packs with ordinary wolves. They hunt down and kill those who survive their attacks to prevent the spread of lycanthropy among non-tribe members. Gray Wolf packs (as the clans call themselves) can be found throughout the North, as far west as the Sword Coast and as far east as the Delimbiyr Vale. Adventurers from Neverwinter recently slew the last great chief of the Gray Wolves, Syken Nightblaze. Envir Sykensdottir has taken over her father's pack and plans to attack Neverwinter to prove that she should be named the next great chief of the tribe.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Great Worm Tribe\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"311\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Great Worm Tribe</span></h3> <p>The Great Worm tribe has fallen under the sway of a brutal chieftain known as Wormblod. The tribe's spirit mound is located inside Great Worm Cavern, in the Spine of the World. Wormblod and his tribe strike out from this cavern only occasionally to defend their territory, which includes the surrounding mountains, the Fell Pass, the Frost Hills, the Lurkwood, and the northern reaches of the Silver Marches. The Great Worms also venture into the Crags and the plains west of the Surbrin Hills when food is scarce. Wherever he goes, Wormblod wages war and hoards any treasure he finds.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Griffon Tribe\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"312\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Griffon Tribe</span></h3> <p>The great chief of the Griffon tribe, @UUID[Actor.ZBuzKZJfRMbAvHTS]{Halric Bonesnapper}, is the great-grandson of Kralgar Bonesnapper, who was killed by orcs many years ago. Like his ancestor, Halric longs to wipe out the cities of the North, but his tribe has made too many enemies of late, and its numbers are dwindling. The tribe still maintains a permanent walled settlement in the Surbrin Hills called Griffon's Nest, but it's more of a guarded encampment than the welcoming trading post it once was. The tribe's spirit mound, Shining White, is northeast of the settlement, near an artery of the Surbrin River. Some of the more jaded tribesfolk believe that the Bonesnapper clan has lost Uthgar's divine favor. Halric refutes such claims by staging bold raids. Griffon barbarians venture as far west as the Sword Coast and as far east as the Silver Marches, and they are known to raid homesteads and ranches in the Dessarin Valley north of Triboar and Yartar.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Red Tiger Tribe\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"313\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Red Tiger Tribe</span></h3> <p>The ferocious Red Tiger tribe shares the spirit mound at Beorunna's Well with the Black Lion tribe, and the two tribes are tenuous allies. Whereas the Black Lions tend to avoid settlements in the Silver Marches, the Red Tigers attack them often. They also prey on caravans traveling along the roads while skillfully avoiding the heavily fortified keeps built to watch over them. The tribe even attacks boats on the Rauvin River from time to time. Recently, Red Tiger hunters have moved into the forests that surround the Silver Marches, and are even making forays into elf-controlled regions of the High Forest in an effort to find the Grandfather Tree and lay claim to it. Seriska Hungermaw is the tribe's great chief. She is ruthless yet cautious.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Sky Pony Tribe\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"314\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sky Pony Tribe</span></h3> <p>During the War of the Silver Marches, Sky Pony barbarians harried and attacked orcs that spilled out of the mountains. Great Chief Arnzan Vashk was badly wounded in one such altercation, leaving him with an orc spearhead embedded in his chest. He refuses to have it removed and tries to hide the pain it causes, not realizing that the tip of the weapon is close to piercing his heart and killing him. The great chief's rivals are circling and preparing to unseat him. The tribe's spirit mound, One Stone, lies in the Moonwood.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Thunderbeast Tribe\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"315\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Thunderbeast Tribe</span></h3> <p>The spirit mound of the Thunderbeast tribe, a bone-strewn hill called Morgur's Mound, lies in the Crags. Members of the tribe have not visited the site in years, and there have been no encounters with Thunderbeast tribesfolk in what used to be their favored hunting grounds in and around the Crags. Great Chief Harthulk Hornspear is a monstrous man with a terrible scowl and skin as cracked and tough as dinosaur leather. He has convinced all of the Thunderbeast clans to hide in the depths of the Lurkwood and is arming them for a \"stampede\" through the Surbrin Hills and the Dessarin Valley to the south—a bold thrust that won't end until his people or their enemies are all dead.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Tree Ghost Tribe\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"316\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tree Ghost Tribe</span></h3> <p>After years of conflict with other Uthgardt tribes and the elves of the High Forest, the Tree Ghosts have declared themselves to be the protectors of the Grandfather Tree. Rarely seen, these Uthgardt share the High Forest with the region's native elves. Great Chief Boorvald Orcbane, true to his name, hunts orcs and frequently launches attacks against the crude Iceshield orc-holds along the western edge of the forest. Boorvald has six sons and three daughters, each of whom was given an @UUID[Item.PX6RYXWPppkZU8MV]{oathbow} from the tribe's elf neighbors as a gift of friendship. Living among the Tree Ghosts are members of various other Uthgardt tribes who found their way to the Grandfather Tree and gained some measure of enlightenment, such that they have forsaken their tribal allegiances and pledged to help the Tree Ghosts protect the tree.</p><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/026-skt03-03.webp\"/>\n</div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Orcs\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"317\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Orcs</span></h2> <p>The history of the North is replete with tales of orc hordes spilling out of the mountains to attack the mines, ranches, farmsteads, and settlements of other folk. These orcs hear the call of Gruumsh, the one-eyed god of slaughter, and must satisfy his hunger for carnage lest he visit ruin upon them. When a particularly strong orc chieftain unites multiple clans under one banner, the resulting horde typically rampages across the land, laying waste to strongholds and slaughtering other creatures in its path. Reghed and Uthgardt clans usually put aside their territorial rivalries to oppose and destroy a rampaging orc horde. Settlements throughout the North form their own coalitions to combat rampaging orcs, with mixed results. The War of the Silver Marches (1484–1485 DR), the latest such conflict, saw orcs fighting alongside white dragons and frost giants. Though the orcs and their mighty allies were defeated and sent scurrying back to their mountain lairs, numerous settlements throughout the Silver Marches were left in ruins, among them the fortress-city of Sundabar.</p><p>Not all orc chieftains are bent on destruction: King Obould Many-Arrows forged a tenuous alliance with his dwarf neighbors and helped maintain peace in the Silver Marches during his tumultuous reign.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Shield Dwarves\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"318\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Shield Dwarves</span></h2> <p>Shield dwarves (also known as mountain dwarves) have a number of strongholds in the North, including Citadel Adbar and Citadel Felbarr in the northern mountains, Sundabar in the Silver Marches, Mithral Hall in the Frost Hills, Ironmaster on the Sword Coast, and Gauntlgrym under the mountains northeast of Neverwinter. Few non-dwarves live in these bastions of dwarvenkind. Outside their walls, clans of shield dwarves are spread thinly throughout the North, to the extent that it's hard to find a settlement that doesn't include at least a handful of dwarven residents. The dwarves' affinity for trade brings them in contact with other races; beyond that, there's also a sense among shield dwarves that all of the North is their land, as evidenced by the ruins of long-lost dwarven kingdoms scattered throughout.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Elves\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"319\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Elves</span></h2> <p>Sun elves and moon elves, like dwarves, live among humans in settlements throughout the North, particularly in Silverymoon. The elven kingdoms of old are distant memories even to elves, and only a few ancient ruins and relics of these kingdoms survive. Wood elves are known to haunt the forests of the North, the High Forest in particular, but they are dangerous and xenophobic.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Halflings\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"320\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Halflings</span></h2> <p>Small populations of lightfoot halflings can be found in most human-dominated settlements of the North. Scattered throughout the fertile valleys of the North are small clusters of strongheart halfling homesteads. Halfling homesteads tend to be off the beaten path and fairly well hidden, thus minimizing the halflings' contact with bandits, barbarians, and marauding monsters. It's not unusual to see a quaint hamlet of halfling homesteads nestled in a grassy ravine or along the shore of a river.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Random Wilderness Encounters\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"321\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Random Wilderness Encounters</span></h1> <p>Characters exploring the North are likely to encounter wandering monsters.

The town is named after one of Waterdeep's early warlords, who is said to haunt the surrounding hills in spirit form, frightening away monsters. Horses are bred and trained here, rich Waterdhavians maintain secluded estates in the hills, and farmland is plentiful. Stands of dark duskwood and spruce trees are everywhere.</p><p>In one corner of the town square stands the Great Shalarn, a black stone statue of a famous war stallion bred in Amphail long ago. Gelded by a prankster, the rearing stone horse is often painted in bright colors by high-spirited locals. Children are allowed to hurl stones at birds perched on the statue, to help keep it free of droppings. The children often climb it themselves and cling precariously to the high, tilted saddle, waving their arms and commanding imaginary armies into battle. Within spitting distance of the statue is the Stag-Horned Flagon, a cozy tavern run by an gray-haired, middle-aged woman with a wry sense of humor named Arleosa Starhenge (NG female Chondathan human @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}). Born in a wild magic zone, Arleosa has the innate magical ability to cast the @spell[alter self] spell three times per day. In her youth, she was a member of a traveling carnival and used this power to entertain folks. She no longer cares about using the ability, and no one in Amphail knows she even has it.</p><p>The three Waterdhavian families with the most influence in Amphail are Houses Amcathra, Ilzimmer, and Roaringhorn. These houses rule the town, with the controlling family changing each Shieldmeet. The current Lord Warder of Amphail is Dauner Ilzimmer (LN male Chondathan human @UUID[Actor.XgAjpoJSv5Bqo6gO]{noble}), a bombastic family man who loves horses more than he does most people. Thanks largely to the influence of its nobles, Amphail is a member of the Lords' Alliance and enjoys the protection of Waterdeep's city guard. The lord warder also hires adventurers from time to time to take care of pesky bandits and monsters.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Suggested Encounter\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"356\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Suggested Encounter</span></h3> <p>It's Tylandar Roaringhorn's sixty-third birthday, and the noble wants all of Amphail to know it. He has imported the finest food and ale from Waterdeep for an outdoor banquet, and everyone in town is invited. Pavilion tents and tables have been set up in the town square. In the middle of the square is a platform where Tylandar plans to thank the crowd. Some cynical Amphailians view Tylandar's birthday banquet as a blatant attempt by the noble to warm hearts before he takes over as lord warder when Lord Ilzimmer's tenure is concluded.</p><p>If the characters stick around for the banquet, three male @UUID[Actor.3TipXibcB2bNDSir]{hill giants}, drawn by the scents of roasted hog and grilled corn, barge into town. Some townsfolk hurl food at the giants, slowing them down long enough for other citizens to clear the square of children and elderly. If the characters do nothing, the town guards help get people to safety while the giants storm the tents and grab armfuls of food before fleeing north along the Long Road. It's clear that the giants mean no harm to the townsfolk.</p><p>If the characters defeat the giants or drive them off before they can grab food, Tylandar Roaringhorn (NG male Chondathan human @UUID[Actor.XgAjpoJSv5Bqo6gO]{noble}) takes notice of their heroism. He tells them afterward that he has received reports of giants of various kinds attacking settlements throughout the Dessarin Valley.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Anauroch\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"357\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Anauroch</span></h2> <p>This once-verdant land is now a desert. Northernmost Anauroch is a cold land of frost-rimed rock and the black glacier known as the High Ice. Farther south lies the waterless Plain of Standing Stones, where winds scour jagged rocks amid a sea of gravel. Anauroch's most southerly part is the Sword—a hot, sandy desert.

Before reaching the edge of Anauroch, the road ends at a great set of stone doors set into a high ridge. Statues of dwarves once stood in rows on either side of these doors, but all that remains of them now are the marble plinths upon which they once stood. The doors open to reveal a passageway that goes underground for nearly a mile before emerging at the desert's edge. Standing outside the yawning exit are two gigantic stone statues of crouching griffons, and beyond them lies one of the great wonders and mysteries of the North: Ascore. This ruined dwarven city once overlooked a sea. Now it lies half-buried in the cold northern sands of Anauroch, its mighty stone docks still thrusting eastward, pointing toward the empty hulks of colossal stone ships lying half-buried in the sand. Dwarven magic once enabled these ships to float on water, but that magic has long since faded.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Suggested Encounter\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"361\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Suggested Encounter</span></h3> <p>The @UUID[Actor.b3fG5Q7uHAbo1oLw]{ancient blue dragon} @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} claims Ascore as part of her domain.

These @UUID[Actor.knfkS7wdvBV0t6dD]{adult blue dragons}, Anaxaster and Chezzaran, frequently accost each other in the sky, playfully jousting and breathing lightning as they zoom around. They are flying over Ascore when the characters first lay eyes on the ruined city. After an hour of fun, the dragons return to their lairs to rest. If the characters take no steps to conceal themselves and enter the city while the dragons are in the sky, the dragons spot the party and attack.</p><p>The ships that the dragons have turned into their lairs are hollow, sand-filled hulks surrounded by open desert. Each ship has [[/r 1d6 + 4]] @UUID[Actor.a1rKDCtMM4XgcFqB]{gargoyles} perched on it, watching the sands for treasure-seekers.

Its structures now entirely cloak a hill that overlooks the village of Womford across the Dessarin River. A long wooden bridge, wide enough for a single wagon to cross, spans the river between these two settlements. Known as the Ironford Bridge, it has stood for centuries but is showing its age.</p><p>Bargewright Inn reeks of manure and filthy mud. It houses dealers who buy and sell horses, mules, and oxen, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, coopers, and wagonmakers. It has inns, stables, and warehouses, and two concentric rings of high walls with gates that are barred at night. (From sunset until dawn, someone who wants to enter or leave can pay a stiff fee to be raised and lowered on a rope-slung chair, but nothing can be taken along beyond what the customer can carry.)</p><p>Bargewright Inn fell under Zhentarim influence a few years ago. Any member or ally of that faction can find a discreet welcome (and few or low fees) within its walls. Bargewright Inn is ruled by a plutocracy of business owners, most of whom are in the pockets of the Black Network. The unofficial leader is Chalaska Muruin (LN female Damaran human @UUID[Actor.iDlg4HChHwAG5ADN]{veteran}), the terse, cold-eyed \"Senior Sword\" and master of the militia.</p><p>The largest inn, the Old Bargewright, was recently rebuilt as a substantial stone structure with thick walls and private chambers hidden behind secret doors. Innkeeper Nalaskur Thaelond (N male half-elf @UUID[Actor.BWrtdHO2w27ozfLx]{spy}) keeps watch over who comes and goes, for this is where Zhentarim operatives meet to broker deals involving smuggled goods, poisons, dangerous magic, and the like. Nalaskur is a member of the Black Network.</p><p>One of the inn's few permanent residents is Arik Stillmarsh, a well-dressed, young-looking man with a sallow complexion who lives like a hermit in a corner room on the uppermost floor of the old inn. Rumor among the rabble has it that Stillmarsh swindled one or more prominent Waterdhavian families, and that the Black Network is sheltering him. In truth, Stillmarsh is a @UUID[Actor.LFtemVjSNJpezjwr]{vampire} (NE male Tethyrian human) whom Nalaskur occasionally calls upon to dispose of unwanted guests. Stillmarsh has an agreement with Nalaskur not to feed on locals or other guests without the Black Network's approval. To sate his appetite at other times, he preys on rural encampments, night travelers on the Long Road, and the poor people of Womford. In Womford, the vampire is spoken of in whispers as the \"Womford Bat.\"</p><p>Stillmarsh's earth-filled coffin is hidden in the attic above his room at the Old Bargewright, accessible through a secret door in the ceiling of a closet.

The community has a public well, as well as a pond where harnessed horses or oxen can be driven through the water to bathe them, drive off flies, and let them drink. It also boasts a tanner, a smith, some horse dealers and trainers who keep extensive stables, and an inn: the venerable, popular, and several-times-expanded Watchful Knight. The inn was named for an inoperative helmed horror that once stood in the common room. The creature mysteriously vanished years ago, and the innkeeper went missing shortly thereafter.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Suggested Encounter\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"365\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Suggested Encounter</span></h3> <p>Hill giants have attacked many of the cattle ranches around Beliard. Every attack is the same: the giants ignore the ranchers and instead raid the animal pens, making off with pigs, @UUID[Actor.Ssu8OtSpU5Fg2r7S]{sheep}, chicken coops, and cattle. The ranch owners have pooled their resources and posted \"Adventurers Wanted!\" signs that promise a payment of 500 gp to anyone who finds out where the hill giants' lair is located. Characters who visit the Watchful Knight and question its patrons learn that most of the giants fled southward with their loot. Characters who explore the hills south of Beliard might find an old tower containing a female hill giant who recently lost her mate (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000003#old-tower]{Old Tower}\" section at the end of this chapter).</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Beorunna's Well\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"366\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beorunna's Well</span></h2> <p>The spirit mound of the Black Lion and Red Tiger tribes of Uthgardt barbarians rests in the heart of the Druarwood. It's not a mound per se, but an ice-cold cavern whose ceiling is partially open to the sky. Characters are likely to come upon at least one Black Lion or Red Tiger hunting party as they make their way toward the site.</p><p>According to Uthgardt legend, Beorunna, a barbarian hero, died fighting a demon in these woods. In the final moments of the battle, the ground beneath Beorunna's feet crumbled, plunging him into a cavern. The triangular cavern contains, among other things, a heated pool with a steady geyser. This pool came to be known as Beorunna's Well. Uthgardt barbarians exploring the cavern for the first time found what they thought were Beorunna's bones, which actually belonged to a half-ogre.</p><p>Uthgar's followers buried the half-ogre's bones alongside a relic stolen from their enemies, the giants, and built an altar upon the burial site. When the barbarians call upon Uthgar for guidance or seek to appease their totem spirits, they slaughter a woodland beast and place its carcass atop the altar, where it slowly rots. Today, the tribes maintain a tenuous truce and take turns protecting their spirit mound. Each tribe has erected its own totem pole near the altar. The Black Lion totem pole is covered with dried pitch and has a lion's skull atop it. The Red Tiger totem pole is stained with blood and has a tiger's skull surmounting it.</p><p>A small stand of pine trees called the Sunken Grove grows in the middle of the cavern. Outside the perimeter of the grove, the cavern is hooded by a ceiling lined with stalactites and pierced with tree roots. The floor around the outside of the Sunken Grove beneath the ceiling is dotted with stalagmites.</p><p>The distance from the top of the pit to the cavern floor is 250 feet. The Uthgardt barbarians have tied a long, knotted rope to a tree stump and left it dangling in the cavern. The barbarians use this rope (and others like it) to climb into and out of Beorunna's Well, and characters can climb the rope (no ability check required). In the northeast corner, surrounding a campfire, are three crude tents inhabited by members of the Black Lion tribe (see \"Suggested Encounter\").</p><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img alt=\"Map 3.2: Beorunna's Well\" class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/028-skt03-beorunnaswell.webp\" title=\"Map 3.2: Beorunna's Well\"/>\n</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner\">Map 3.2: Beorunna's Well</div></div></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img alt=\"Player Version\" class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/029-301.webp\" title=\"Player Version\"/>\n</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner\">Player Version</div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Ancient Relic\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"367\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ancient Relic</span></h3> <p>The altar is a blood-spattered stone block, 9 feet long by 6 feet wide by 3 feet tall, weighing several tons.

Using her hard-won wealth and influence, she attracted settlers to the region, giving rise to a small village whose citizens pay monthly \"tithes\" for Tamalin's protection. Still spry at sixty, Tamalin is \"the law\" in Calling Horns—an irony that never ceases to amuse her. She employs nine deputies (N male and female @UUID[Actor.iDlg4HChHwAG5ADN]{veterans} of various races) who live in the village proper to help keep the peace. Tamalin also gives free room and board to adventurers who help solve local problems.

The fortress, carved out of a mountain spur, consists of two great towers ringed with spikes to keep large flying creatures from landing to attack the structures directly. The great chimney of the citadel's central foundry stands between the towers, belching smoke like a volcano about to erupt. Ringing the citadel is a host of platforms, battlements, and arrow slits from where defenders can fire crossbows at foolish attackers. A great drawbridge allows no one to enter the dwarven enclave except patrols and honored guests. Cleverly hidden traps await those who storm the halls uninvited, and beneath the citadel is an expansive network of tunnels and caverns designed to confuse would-be invaders. If Adbar's defenses should ever prove inadequate, the dwarves have created a secret evacuation tunnel that stretches for hundreds of miles, connecting to passages that lie under Citadel Felbarr to the west. Adbar's garrison offers a reward of 10 gp for each orc head brought to the city gates, or 100 gp for each giant head.</p><p>The population of Citadel Adbar was severely depleted by the War of the Silver Marches, which drew away many of Adbar's greatest warriors, including its long-ruling king, Harbromm. King Harbromm led his knights into battle against the orc hordes invading the Marches and died on the field. Harbromm's twin sons, Bromm and Harnoth, inherited the throne and, like their father, left Citadel Adbar to join the war. Bromm later perished, leaving the crown to Harnoth. Harnoth and his followers fought many battles during the war, but the new king made some poor decisions that winnowed the once-great Knights of the Mithral Shield down to a handful of members. Fortunately for Harnoth, the Iron Guard—Citadel Adbar's defending army—remains strong.</p><p>What's not generally known is that Harnoth, too, was killed by orcs toward the end of the war. To prevent political turmoil in Citadel Abdar, the elders of Adbar's dwarven clans hired a @UUID[Actor.vK6i3kg9rDtkzb6l]{doppelganger} to impersonate King Harnoth. True power in Citadel Adbar now lies with the clan elders, who meet in secret and tell their \"king\" what to do and say before every one of his public appearances. The doppelganger is so smitten with its role that it sometimes forgets itself and makes decisions that the elders haven't approved, behavior that is a growing cause of concern for some.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Suggested Encounter\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"378\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Suggested Encounter</span></h3> <p>Adventurers are welcome in Citadel Adbar, and news of their arrival is quickly brought to the doppelganger-king's attention. After meeting with the clan elders, \"Harnoth\" demands a private audience with the adventurers in his throne hall. In the presence of three elders (LG male shield dwarf @UUID[Actor.XgAjpoJSv5Bqo6gO]{nobles} armed with warhammers instead of rapiers) and four bodyguards (LG male and female shield dwarf @UUID[Actor.A8tA2fvXYY2m4iML]{guards} armed with warhammers instead of spears), the king asks the characters to attack Ironslag, a fire giant forge in the mountains to the northwest. Dwarven patrols have seen fire giants hauling large fragments of adamantine to the underground forge, which had until recently stood abandoned. \"Harnoth\" wants the adventurers to find out what the giants are doing and thwart them if possible.</p><p>\"Harnoth\" promises that if the characters agree to explore Ironslag and return with evidence of a successful mission, such as @UUID[Actor.dEAfcnl04rCFkRQm]{Duke Zalto}'s head or a group of freed dwarven prisoners, he will reward each character with a rare magic item of that individual's choice. He secures the desired items while the characters are off completing their quest. If the characters have already cleared out Ironslag, the king expresses his surprise and gratitude and urges them to rest in Adbar while he gathers their rewards. For more information on Ironslag, see chapter 8, \"@UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008]{Forge of the Fire Giants}.\"</p><p>As the doppelganger-king is trying to persuade the adventurers to undertake his quest, or in the wake of their foray to Ironslag, seven @UUID[Actor.CEDM7DEgL7mDnSpq]{yakfolk warriors} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000015]{appendix C}) barge into the throne hall to kill the king and the adventurers. The yakfolk have used their Wind Ghost power to possess six @UUID[Actor.L1cSSnHl7dglC0U4]{Knights of the Mithral Shield}.

As combat ensues, the elders withdraw from the audience chamber to summon reinforcements, which arrive after the battle ends. As the characters battle the knights, the king's bodyguards surround and protect their lord. They join the fray only if the characters are on the verge of defeat.</p><p>If the adventurers defeat the possessed dwarves, \"Harnoth\" urges them to stay in Citadel Adbar for a couple of days while he arranges for suitable rewards. He commissions jewelers to craft mithral medals (one per character) shaped like shields, and he also drafts a signed letter of recommendation and presents it to the party. The bearer of the letter gains advantage on Charisma checks made to influence shield dwarves throughout the North.

The succubus has imprisoned the real duchess in Cromm's Hold, a keep on the edge of the Lizard Marsh (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000003#lizard-marsh]{Lizard Marsh}\" entry for details). Pencheska is using her position to infiltrate the Lords' Alliance.

Pencheska has forged a promising alliance with the Black Network, and her primary Zhentarim contact in town is a plump halfling weasel named Nelkin Danniker (N male lightfoot halfling @UUID[Actor.BWrtdHO2w27ozfLx]{spy}), known to his associates as the Snail because of his slow, deliberate way of talking.

A thick stone wall encloses the city, pierced in five places by gates. Like the spokes of a wheel, broad, straight avenues lead from each gate to the Bell Market at the city's center. The streets are clean and wide enough to accommodate large caravan vehicles. Soldiers of the city's army make a show of patrolling the walls, to reassure citizens and visitors as well as to discourage attackers. The buildings of Everlund are stately and well maintained, with steeply pitched rooftops and tall spires that sport colorful banners. Two bridges span the river, which has parks and trees along its shores.</p><p>Until recently, Everlund was a member of the Lords' Alliance. The five leaders who currently comprise the city's Council of Elders voted three to two in favor of separation and, in a symbolic show of support for Sundabar (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000003#sundabar]{Sundabar}\" section), condemned the alliance for its failure to come to Sundabar's aid during the War of the Silver Marches. The decision was touted as an opportunity for Everlund to chart its own course, but more educated citizens believe the vote was orchestrated by the Zoar family, a group of influential nobles that moved to Everlund from Waterdeep over a century ago amid some scandal. The Zoars have gained considerable political influence in Everlund, to the extent that they now have a representative on the Council of Elders.</p><p>The Hall of the Elders is where the council meets to discuss issues affecting the city. Only the councilors know who voted which way concerning the decision to leave the Lords' Alliance. The members of the Council of Elders are as follows:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">High Captain Horix Zoar (LN male Tethyrian human @UUID[Actor.XgAjpoJSv5Bqo6gO]{noble}), commander of Everlund's army and a windbag</li><li class=\"rd__li\">High Sorcerer Vaeril Rhuidhen (NG male sun elf @UUID[Actor.tYFhaFeqOwyJdTzs]{archmage}), a quiet voice of moderation and reason who keeps the peace between the council's more fractious members (and who formerly served as liaison to the Lords' Alliance)</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The Keeper of the Bridges, Kythora Shen (LN female Shou human @UUID[Actor.iDlg4HChHwAG5ADN]{veteran}), a retired soldier and skilled bureaucrat charged with overseeing the city watch and the conduct of commerce in the city</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The Master of Guilds, Boldor Steelshield (N male shield dwarf @UUID[Actor.XgAjpoJSv5Bqo6gO]{noble}), representing the merchants of Everlund, who is prone to hyperbole and rumored to accept bribes</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The Speaker of the Town, a citizen elected every seven years to represent the common folk in the city; currently the post is held by Vatrice Stormwright (CG female Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}), an easily flustered woman who owns a modestly successful chimney-sweeping business in the city</li></ul><p>The most prominent edifice in Everlund is Moongleam Tower, a keep of black stone that serves as a Harper stronghold in the North. It rises from one of the higher knolls in the city and consists of four narrow, cylindrical towers joined together, surrounded by a dry moat that can be quickly flooded through a system of cisterns and pumps. Crowning the roof is an open turret, where a signaling mirror shaped like a crescent moon stands.</p><p>At any time, from five to fifteen Harpers are in residence, attended by a loyal staff and a private garrison of twenty veterans. Moonlord Daviana Yalrannis (CG female Tethyrian human @UUID[Actor.JjLaza8KBv8kODS5]{knight}) is the master of the tower, charged with its defense and upkeep. A powerful Harper wizard named Krowen Valharrow (CG male Turami human @UUID[Actor.tYFhaFeqOwyJdTzs]{archmage} with a @UUID[Item.AXe27Xs4Elp6ccQp]{robe of useful items} and a @UUID[Item.PLqlAlsEQ92hOI3Y]{staff of fire}) also resides in the tower, along with dozens of domesticated @UUID[Actor.C6dg1kEECfaPv7fY]{tressym} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000015]{appendix C}) and a handful of apprentice @UUID[Actor.sMYXCW2K2ptMY1Wb]{mages}. Apart from their ability to fly, the tressym behave like normal house cats. If one or more characters show an interest in the tressym, Krowen offers to bequeath one (but no more than one) to the party. The tressym bonds with the first character to earn its trust, which requires some obvious sign of affection accompanied by a successful [[/save ability=cha dc=17]] check. A character with proficiency in the &amp;Reference[skill=AnimalHandling]{Animal Handling} skill has advantage on the check. The bonded tressym obeys that character's commands and no one else's.</p><p>Near the top of Moongleam Tower is a circular, windowless room that contains a permanent @spell[teleportation circle], which high-ranking Harpers use to enter and leave the tower unseen (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000003#inner-circles]{Inner Circles}\" section at the end of this chapter).</p><p>The city boasts many temples, the most prominent of which are dedicated to Helm, Mielikki, and Corellon Larethian. Everlund also has many fine places to eat and rest, the oldest and largest being Danivarr's House. Once a noble's mansion, this rambling inn is a favorite haunt for adventurers. The Zoar family bought the establishment a few years ago, but leaves the running of Danivarr's House to a one-eyed half-orc named Dral Thelev (LG male half-orc @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}). Both the Harpers and the Zhentarim keep a close eye on this place.</p><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img alt=\"Map 3.3: Everlund\" class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/030-skt03-everlund.webp\" title=\"Map 3.3: Everlund\"/>\n</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner\">Map 3.3: Everlund</div></div></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img alt=\"Player Version\" class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/031-302.webp\" title=\"Player Version\"/>\n</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner\">Player Version</div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Development\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"395\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Development</span></h3> <p>If the characters received a letter of recommendation from Tamalin Zoar (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000003#calling-horns]{Calling Horns}\" section) and they show it to Dral Thelev, the half-orc tells them that the Zoar family has power in the city and that the characters can give the letter of recommendation to Dral in exchange for one favor from the Zoars (see the \"<a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,7,marks%20of%20prestige,0\">Marks of Prestige</a>\" section in <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,7\">chapter 7</a> of the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>). When the characters decide to call in the favor, Dral contacts his employers, and High Captain Horix Zoar does everything in his power to give the characters what they want, provided it's within his power and isn't likely to burden him or the Zoar family. Examples of what he might provide include a meeting with one or more members of the Council of Elders, an arranged meeting with a Lords' Alliance representative from another city, and a @UUID[Item.EGDPqIbmCsap6n3L]{spell scroll} of @spell[raise dead].</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Evermoor Way\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"396\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Evermoor Way</span></h2> <p>The Evermoor Way has long been a vital trade route, connecting the settlements of the Dessarin Valley with those of the Silver Marches. The section between Triboar and Yartar is an ancient road, relatively flat and composed of tight-fitting stones. East of Yartar, the road becomes a gravel and dirt wagon trail that passes a little too close to the Evermoors for most merchants' comfort. Between Olostin's Hold and Everlund, the trail passes through an area that used to be forest and is now full of tree stumps. Efforts to turn this long stretch into a proper road have long been thwarted by disagreements between the leaders of Yartar and Everlund, and Everlund's exit from the Lords' Alliance has dashed all hope.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Evermoors\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"397\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Evermoors</span></h2> <p>The Evermoors is a vast, unsettled area of fog-shrouded hills, cold bogs, rocky ridges, and small peaks. Adventurers crossing this expanse might spot the occasional castle ruin or crumbled tower—a remnant of a bygone realm. Although the region attracts many prospectors, no kingdom or civilization in recent history has been able to tame it. Savage hill giants, ettins, ogres, orcs, and trolls dwell here in great numbers. Settlements that stand on the edge of the Evermoors face constant threats from these and other monsters.</p><p>Floating a mile above the Evermoors is Lyn Armaal, @UUID[Actor.WDyUyhSwWBwZaTiF]{Countess Sansuri}'s cloud castle (see chapter 9, \"@UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000010]{Castle of the Cloud Giants}\").

In the years that followed, miners settled nearby, giving rise to the town of Fireshear. The miners work for a consortium of three allied merchant companies: Hammaver House (based in Mirabar), the Silver Triangle (based in Neverwinter), and the Delvers of Brokenstone (based in Waterdeep). The settlement is made up of squat stone structures that resemble igloos, their domes good at supporting the weight of snow and deflecting the cold wind. Most homes are dug out of the rock and include deep cellars laden with preserves.</p><p>The miners of Fireshear dwell here all year. Ramps carved into the cliffs lead down to the shore, where stone docks protrude into a shallow bay that freezes by late fall and doesn't thaw until early summer. Fireshear imports most of its food, clothing, and other necessities. Ice fishing is a popular pastime among children, but all able-bodied adults are expected to toil in the mines.</p><p>The town has three leaders, who form a ruling triumvirate that handles trade negotiations with representatives of other settlements and disperses supplies among the townsfolk. Each member is a representative of one of the town's founding companies. Triumvirate members serve for life or until they resign, and they are known to take bribes, rewarding families who pay them in coin or precious ore with supplies of higher quality or in greater quantity. The current members are Tharkus Gromm (NE male shield dwarf @UUID[Actor.dleF6z2lXhdoBTLV]{thug}) of Hammaver House; Darva (NG female dragonborn @UUID[Actor.sMYXCW2K2ptMY1Wb]{mage}) of the Silver Triangle; and Zalaron Daska (N male Tethyrian human @UUID[Actor.iDlg4HChHwAG5ADN]{veteran}) of the Delvers of Brokenstone.</p><p>Fireshear is also home to a retired civilar (captain) of Waterdeep's Griffon Cavalry and a member of the Emerald Enclave named Dasharra Keldabar (LG female shield dwarf @UUID[Actor.iDlg4HChHwAG5ADN]{veteran}). She lives north of town, in a mostly underground hovel on a ridge that overlooks the sea. Locals know that Dasharra raises griffons, trains them as mounts, and teaches people how to ride them. The griffons are kept in a low, sturdy wooden shelter next to her home. At any time, Dasharra has [[/r 1d4 + 6]] adult @UUID[Actor.gRPvPiIKnUa83SkY]{griffons} and [[/r 1d4]] griffon eggs in her care. Dasharra employs six Zhentarim mercenaries (N male and female Tethyrian human @UUID[Actor.iDlg4HChHwAG5ADN]{veterans}) as guards, three of whom stand watch outside the griffon pens while the others rest in a cramped loft above the griffons' stalls.</p><p>If one or more characters are members of the Emerald Enclave, the adventurers can easily convince Dasharra to help them fly to Svardborg, Lyn Armaal, or some other destination within a few hundred miles of Fireshear. Otherwise, they must pay for her services. She charges 250 gp per person for training and another 25 gp per person per day of travel. Characters who want to be trained must undergo three days of intense lessons, after which they know enough about griffon riding to control their mounts. Each griffon is able to carry one Medium rider or two Small riders (along with their armor and portable gear), and Dasharra has saddles and reins sized for both Small and Medium riders. Dasharra's \"alpha griffon,\" Screecher, allows no one but her to ride it. Dasharra's other griffons are trained to follow Screecher wherever it goes and can't be coaxed into veering off course unless they are magically &amp;Reference[condition=charmed].</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Suggested Encounter\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"403\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Suggested Encounter</span></h3> <p>Three days after the characters arrive in Fireshear, a frost giant greatship with white dragon wings for sails and mammoth tusks lashed to its bow emerges from the thick fog shrouding the coastline. The greatship (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000007#reclaiming-svardborg]{Svardborg: General Features}\" sidebar in chapter 7, \"@UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007]{Berg of the Frost Giants}\") cuts a swath through the icy crust over the shallow bay as it approaches and slowly grinds to a dead stop. The ship carries twenty @UUID[Actor.0e4VCY9QHJ0DVAAa]{frost giants}. Twelve of them leap over the sides, walking across ice or wading through frigid waist-deep water toward the docks, eager to raid and pillage. The remaining eight frost giants remain aboard the ship.</p><p>As townsfolk retreat to the mines or flee across the open tundra, the raiding giants fan out, allowing characters to take on two or three of them at a time. Dasharra provides aerial support, attacking giants at range with her heavy crossbow while mounted atop her griffon. If six or more frost giants fall in battle, the rest retreat to their ship. Left alone, the surviving frost giants (including those that didn't participate in the initial assault) regroup and launch a second attack [[/r 1d4 + 1]] hours later, this time leaving no giant behind.</p><p>The frost giant raid occurs whether the characters remain in town or not. If the characters aren't present to defend the town, the frost giant raiders force hundreds of townsfolk to take refuge in the mines. The giants pile boulders in front of the mine entrances to trap the townsfolk inside, then loot the town. Townsfolk who fled into the tundra rather than hide in the mines return [[/r 2d6]] hours later to find their homes reduced to rubble and their supplies gone.

The secret door is between the two groups—20 feet from the drow party and 40 feet from the adventuring party at the start of the encounter—and the characters have no prior knowledge of it.

Perched atop a rocky crag and surrounded by high battlements, Hawk's Nest is under the protection of the Order of the Gauntlet. High stone walls enclose a keep and a densely packed village that includes three small temples (dedicated to Helm, Torm, and Tyr), a blacksmith, a leatherworker, a caravan supplier, a rough-and-tumble tavern (the Spiked Gauntlet), and two cozy yet spacious inns (the Hawk's Roost and the Inn of the Silver Sword).</p><p>The Lord of Hawk's Nest is Arthus Cavilos (LG male Damaran human @UUID[Actor.JjLaza8KBv8kODS5]{knight} of Tyr), a member of the Order of the Gauntlet. His wife, Lady Fenris Agathonn (LG female Damaran human @UUID[Actor.sMYXCW2K2ptMY1Wb]{mage}), is the great grand niece of Lord Taern Hornblade of Silverymoon. Arthun and Fenris have two spirited daughters, Lavencia and Eryl; one is training to be a wizard, the other a knight of Tyr like her father.</p><p>Lord Cavilos raises @UUID[Actor.d3LXWpkp6Xa8exjW]{hippogriffs}, which the knights of Hawk's Nest train as mounts and use to patrol the trade road between Silverymoon and Sundabar. Characters who are looking for an expeditious means of travel can petition Lord Cavilos to ferry them to their destination on the backs of hippogriffs. If the characters impress upon him the urgency of their mission, Lord Cavilos commands his fellow knights to fly the characters where they need to go, then return to Hawk's Nest with the hippogriffs. A hippogriff carrying a knight and one other rider must rest for 1 hour for every 3 hours it flies, and can travel about 54 miles per day.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Suggested Encounter\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"441\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Suggested Encounter</span></h3> <p>When fire giants attack an armored wagon heading east to Sundabar, knights on hippogriffs are forced to swoop down, rescue the survivors, and deliver them back to Hawk's Nest. The characters learn about the attack when the knights return with the survivors. They also find out that the armored wagon was transporting wages to workers who are rebuilding Sundabar's defenses, which were destroyed during the War of the Silver Marches. Characters can show their valor by undertaking a quest to retrieve the stolen wages, which were kept in two locked iron strongboxes. While traveling east along the trade road, the characters come upon the wreckage of the armored wagon. From there they can follow fire giant tracks heading north into the mountains. Several hours later, they come upon two @UUID[Actor.F1AVeHwz6A3I0h14]{fire giants} and two @UUID[Actor.KAKItQutIu6MiDs2]{hell hounds}.

If the party includes a paladin or a cleric of good alignment who isn't already a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, Lord Cavilos offers that character membership in the order. If the party already includes any members of the order, Lord Cavilos offers each of them a knighthood and a hippogriff mount.

Helm's Hold is firmly under the Gilded Eye's control, and its members have taken Helm's doctrine of protection to extremes. The high-minded inquisitors of the Gilded Eye are convinced that evil is rampant. They are determined to root out those under \"demonic influence\" and are quick to persecute anyone who doesn't act in accordance with their beliefs.</p><p>Within the walls of Helm's Hold are numerous residences surrounding a central district called the Heartward, wherein the characters can find a roomy tavern (called the Old Dirty Dwarf), several quiet hostels, and a bustling marketplace. A wooden hangman's scaffold stands in the center of the marketplace, and on certain nights, when clouds obscure the waning moon, luminous ghosts wander around it, going about the business of the living. Phantom vendors sell ephemeral apples at empty stands, ghost children play in the streets, and spirits hang one another on the scaffold. Some of the scenes appear to be reenactments of past events, whereas others have not occurred—at least, not yet. The ghosts speak mostly nonsense, but some of what they say might offer clues to past or future happenings.</p><p>Dominating the skyline is the Cathedral of Helm, a towering and inspiring edifice of pale gray stone that's visible for miles around. As much a fortress as a temple, the cathedral contains an orphanage, a hospital, an asylum, and training grounds for Gilded Eye initiates. Holy Watcher Qerria (LG female Tethyrian human @UUID[Actor.BSvzE801ExHkxapo]{priest} of Helm), who presides over the cathedral, is determined to root out corruption wherever she finds it. Few doubt that her words carry the weight of Helm's divine wisdom. She is served by dozens of Gilded Eye inquisitors (male and female @UUID[Actor.z3qqraxeblJt0M9F]{cult fanatics} of various alignments and ethnicities) who employ a host of @UUID[Actor.qFwpg1AoUJSor5U6]{acolytes}, @UUID[Actor.M8U97ZHHUCo57VXi]{assassins}, @UUID[Actor.A8tA2fvXYY2m4iML]{guards}, @UUID[Actor.JjLaza8KBv8kODS5]{knights}, @UUID[Actor.BWrtdHO2w27ozfLx]{spies}, and @UUID[Actor.iDlg4HChHwAG5ADN]{veterans}. Evildoers and enemies of the Gilded Eye are rounded up and brought to Helm's Hold to face judgment. Those deemed to be under \"demonic influence\" or those who threaten the Gilded Eye are hanged, their bodies burned to ashes to prevent them from being raised from the dead.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Suggested Encounter\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"444\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Suggested Encounter</span></h3> <p>Adventurers who enter Helm's Hold are watched closely by the Gilded Eye. However, as long as they don't stir up trouble, they have little to fear from the order, which prides itself on making visitors feel safe and protected. The Gilded Eye relies on trade to finance its activities, and adventurers are usually good for the settlement's economy. The Gilded Eye is also known to use adventurers to do its dirty work.</p><p>The leaders of the Gilded Eye have received reports of giant marauders in the region. Trained to deal with demonic threats, the order is less keen to face giants in battle. Zara Dalkor (LG female Illuskan @UUID[Actor.JjLaza8KBv8kODS5]{knight} of Helm) and her squire, Thora Tamlarrin (LN female Tethyrian half-elf @UUID[Actor.A8tA2fvXYY2m4iML]{guard}), approach the characters and offer them the opportunity to help the Gilded Eye and the people of Helm's Hold, promising nothing in return except the Gilded Eye's gratitude. If the characters decline to help, Zara apologizes for taking up their time and reports back to her superiors.</p><p>If the characters express any interest in helping the Gilded Eye, Zara shares the following information:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">Scouts from Helm's Hold have spotted frost giants wandering the lands to the south.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The frost giants have attacked and plundered several homesteads and caravans along the High Road.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The Gilded Eye wants the characters to find out where the giants are coming from.</li></ul><p>Characters who accept the quest and head south for 10 miles spot a @UUID[Actor.0e4VCY9QHJ0DVAAa]{frost giant} walking toward the coast. The giant recently attacked a caravan traveling north along the High Road and has 88 hit points remaining. He carries a sack stuffed with pillaged food as well as [[/r 1d4]] mundane items (roll on the Items in a Giant's Bag table in the introduction). The giant fights to the death if he is attacked. If the characters follow the giant while keeping their distance, he leads them to a miles-long stretch of 100-foot-high cliffs. Anchored a half mile off the coast is a greatship (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000007#frost-giants]{Svardborg: General Features}\" sidebar in chapter 7, \"Berg of the Frost Giants\") with two giant-sized punts tethered to it. Three @UUID[Actor.0e4VCY9QHJ0DVAAa]{frost giants} are aboard the ship. When the giant carrying the sack of food waves from the top of the cliffs, one of the giants aboard the ship climbs into a punt and rows it to shore, while the first giant climbs down the cliff to meet it. Most of the ship's crew is still plundering the mainland, so the ship isn't leaving anytime soon.</p><p>Sixteen frost giants have yet to return to the ship from their inland raids. If the characters hide aboard the ship or remain within sight of it, roll a [[/r d20]] at the end of each hour that passes.

Larger than most kingdoms, it encompasses mountains. The High Forest is home to treants of enormous size, stags with antlers as wide across as a wagon, brown bears bigger than large sheds, owlbears, wolves, unicorns, and many other creatures, including fiercely territorial wood elves and Uthgardt barbarians of the Tree Ghost tribe. The forest holds many hidden settlements, haunted ruins, fey crossings, and ancient magical wards.</p><p>In the outermost fringes of the forest, woodcutters ply their trade, and outlaws on the run might find refuge. But as everyone knows, those who venture too deep into the High Forest are often not seen again.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"High Moor\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"447\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">High Moor</span></h2> <p>The High Moor isn't part of the North per se. A great cataclysm occurred here long ago, wiping out an entire elven kingdom, but little evidence of this event now remains except for some haunted ruins, tombs, and dungeons shrouded in thick fog. Many adventurers have perished in search of these ancient sites, for the High Moor is home to many monsters.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"High Road\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"448\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">High Road</span></h2> <p>This well-traveled highway follows the coast from Luskan to Waterdeep, connecting with Neverwinter along the way. For years, the stretch of the High Road between Neverwinter and Waterdeep fell into disuse and disrepair because of frequent monster attacks. When he was both the Lord Protector of Neverwinter and the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Lord Dagult Neverember hired adventurers to make the old road safe and spent considerable coin to repair it. Many now consider the High Road a safer means of travel than a sea voyage.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Hundelstone\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"449\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hundelstone</span></h2> <p>At the highest elevations along Ten Trail, only a few shrubs cling to life amid patches of moss-covered rock. Travelers on this route eventually come to Hundelstone, perching on the mountain slopes much like the surrounding flora. The town's buildings are low, with most of their rooms cut out of the hard soil and rock below ground level, and their roofs steeply pitched to better shed the snows that blanket the mountains in the winter. The shield dwarves and rock gnomes in Hundelstone get a chuckle out of warning visitors to stoop low as they walk about town, lest they be blown away by the wind.</p><p>For most people, Hundelstone is either the last outpost of civilization before taking the pass north to Icewind Dale or the first welcome sign of refuge after making the wearying trip back. Many of the dwarves and gnomes here spend their days excavating tunnels, mining ore, or smelting and smithing the local iron and tin. (Adventurers who venture down into these tunnels might be surprised to find that some of them descend for miles, in some cases all the way to the Underdark.) Hundelstone's few score human residents are mostly sellswords or would-be adventurers who earn a living as caravan guards or beast hunters in the crags.</p><p>One notable resident of Hundelstone is an inventor named Thwip Ironbottom (CG male rock gnome @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}). A spy for the Harpers, Thwip keeps an eye on strangers passing through town and uses a @UUID[Item.UkTH8Qm3f9FMv1qC]{sending stone} to stay in touch with @UUID[Actor.nujigulfgyMjG3OS]{Beldora}, a Harper spy in Icewind Dale (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000002#bryn-shander-quests]{Beldora's Quest}\" section in chapter 2 for more information about Thwip).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Ice Peak\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"450\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ice Peak</span></h2> <p>The frozen island that lies southeast of the Sea of Moving Ice is named for the snow-capped promontory that dominates its northern half. Most of the inhabitants live in a few settlements clustered around the twin bays on the southern shore. Caves in the mountain's peak serve as a lair for Arveiaturace, the white wyrm known to sailors as Iceclaws because of her habit of diving on hapless vessels and tearing them apart with her talons.</p><p>Longships crowd the docks of Aurilssbarg, the island's largest community. Typical of the settlements on Ice Peak, the streets of Aurilssbarg are paved with logs laid side by side, and its buildings are low wooden structures whose pitched roofs are covered in sod. The heart of Aurilssbarg is Green Hall, a spacious tavern with a lengthy firepit that can spit six goats at a time to feed the cold and hungry crews that arrive after unloading their ships at the docks. Locals come here as well to hear the latest news from the mainland, although by the time it reaches Ice Peak, such news is often out of date and wildly exaggerated, little better than idle rumor. Still, the isolated inhabitants of Aurilssbarg eat it up all the same.</p><p>The island's smaller coastal settlements include the fishing and trapping villages of Bjorn's Hold and Icewolf. The natives of Ice Peak survive by catching fish and hunting goats, seals, and whales. The island boasts a large yeti population. They feed on mountain goats, avoiding Northlanders unless food is scarce.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Ice Mountains and Ice Spires\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"451\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ice Mountains and Ice Spires</span></h2> <p>The Ice Mountains and the Ice Spires are reckoned by some to be the easternmost extent of the Spine of the World, rather than being mountain ranges in their own right.

The sun never rises far above the horizon even at the height of summer—and the height of summer is a fleeting thing. Winter here is long and ruthless.</p><p>Icewind Dale is surrounded by perilous terrain. The ice cliffs of the Reghed Glacier rise up in the east like prison walls. The towering, snow-capped peaks of the Spine of the World loom to the south. To the north and west, the Sea of Moving Ice churns bergs and floes in an endless tumult, like winter grinding its teeth in anticipation of its next freezing assault. Between these formidable obstacles lies windswept tundra dotted with settlements and the occasional small forest or stand of trees.</p><p>A singular mountain called Kelvin's Cairn rises from the heart of Icewind Dale. During the summer, snow from Kelvin's Cairn flows into three mineral-rich lakes: Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters. By midsummer, Icewind Dale shakes off the torpor of winter and comes forth in full flower. Grasses grow two or three feet high in the span of weeks. Birds flock to the marshes formed by the thawing soil, and reindeer calves fill out the herds that diminished in the winter.</p><p>Reghed barbarians follow the reindeer herds as they migrate across Icewind Dale, and dwarf miners haunt the caves and tunnels under Kelvin's Cairn, rarely emerging except to trade ore for food. Most of Icewind Dale's inhabitants, however, live in ten permanent settlements collectively known as Ten-Towns:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">The walled town of Bryn Shander, which lies at the northern end of the Ten Trail, is the first stop for most visiting merchants and traders and by far the largest of the ten communities.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The hunting and fishing villages of Bremen, Targos, Termalaine, and Lonelywood line the shores of Maer Dualdon, which feeds into the Shaengarne River and holds seemingly countless numbers of knucklehead trout.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The villages of Dougan's Hole and Good Mead stand a few miles apart on the north shore of Redwaters which, contrary to its name, sparkles emerald green during the day and silver in the evening.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The town of Easthaven and, nestled among the foothills of Kelvin's Cairn, the villages of Caer-Dineval and Caer-Konig hug the shores of Lac Dinneshere, which freezes in winter.</li></ul><p>The population of Ten-Towns is composed mostly of humans and dwarves, with the humans outnumbering the dwarves roughly twenty to one. In times of great peril, the leaders of Ten-Towns, known as town speakers, meet at Bryn Shander to discuss solutions to their problems. If one of the smaller settlements comes under attack by a threat too great to overcome, its inhabitants are trained to flee to Bryn Shander and take shelter behind its walls.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Random Encounters\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"454\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Random Encounters</span></h3> <p>When in this region, use the Random Encounters in Icewind Dale table instead of the Random Wilderness Encounters table earlier in this chapter.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Random Encounters in Icewind Dale\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"455\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Random Encounters in Icewind Dale</span></h3> <table class=\"w-100 rd__table stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d20]]</th><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Encounter</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-roll-max=\"1\" data-roll-min=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10\">1 @UUID[Actor.9Buhiq5rgcf43fSZ]{ancient white dragon}</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-roll-max=\"5\" data-roll-min=\"2\">2-5</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10\">[[/r 1d4 + 2]] @UUID[Actor.IldoyOF5wdHtkO3f]{crag cats} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000015]{appendix C})</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-roll-max=\"8\" data-roll-min=\"6\">6-8</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10\">[[/r 1d3]] @UUID[Actor.0e4VCY9QHJ0DVAAa]{frost giants}</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-roll-max=\"12\" data-roll-min=\"9\">9-12</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10\">Reghed barbarians (@UUID[Actor.30Q17KvaUmYKG24U]{berserker} and @UUID[Actor.mWeVluN4sK1YklGf]{tribal warriors})</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-roll-max=\"15\" data-roll-min=\"13\">13-15</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10\">[[/r 3d8]] reindeer (@UUID[Actor.I8fcxny5sH4DxiOR]{elk})</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-roll-max=\"17\" data-roll-min=\"16\">16-17</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10\">Ten-Towners (@UUID[Actor.LTrMewUTBVyx4vkZ]{scouts})</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-roll-max=\"19\" data-roll-min=\"18\">18-19</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10\">[[/r 1d6]] @UUID[Actor.b9kYraFtXZx51vRU]{yeti}</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-roll-max=\"20\" data-roll-min=\"20\">20</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10\">1 @UUID[Actor.P9zXsUybDuOhlpRE]{young remorhaz}</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Ancient White Dragon\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"456\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ancient White Dragon.</span></span> Arveiaturace, better known to Northfolk as Iceclaws, claims Icewind Dale as part of her domain.

It lies on both sides of the Delimbiyr River, the two halves linked by an arching stone overpass built by dwarves to honor the elves. Ancient wards placed on the overpass to preserve it had an unintended magical side effect: river trout attempting to swim under the bridge are propelled over it instead, which is why locals refer to it as the Flying Fish Bridge. People crossing the bridge are occasionally struck by these fish, which deal no damage. Whenever a fish hits a traveler and flops onto the bridge, it's a local custom (and considered good luck) to toss the fish back into the river.</p><p>Once a home to elves, Loudwater is a human town today. Its grand wood-and-stone buildings are overgrown by vines and hung with flowering plants. Streets curl and meander. Huge, old trees line the riverbanks, and gardens and bowers are everywhere. The town replaced its earthen rampart with a wall years ago, but the wall has flowers growing along its foundations both inside and outside the settlement. The river is unusually wide here, providing the town with space for a modest harbor.</p><p>The High Lord's Hall is a mansion on the north side of the river. The town's current high lord is Telbor Zazrek (N male Damaran human @UUID[Actor.sMYXCW2K2ptMY1Wb]{mage}), a retired adventurer and well-paid puppet of the Zhentarim who enjoys the power that has been handed to him. Through Zazrek, the Black Network maintains an invisible stranglehold on the town. All goods that aren't supplied by the Zhentarim are heavily taxed, and the cost of living in Loudwater is so high that all of its establishments are forced to charge exorbitant prices.</p><p>Adding to Loudwater's problems are the stone giants of the Graypeak Mountains (see chapter 6, \"@UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006]{Canyon of the Stone Giants}\"), who have begun laying waste to Llorkh, Orlbar, and the hamlets of Grayvale. Refugees are pouring into Loudwater, and those who can't afford to stay at the local inns are being herded like cows into warehouses overlooking the harbor. As if that weren't bad enough, stone giants have been seen spying on the town from afar, no doubt trying to determine its defensive capabilities. Since the Black Network keeps its forces well hidden in Loudwater and the town militia is a small force, Loudwater might seem like an easy target.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Lurkwood\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"493\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lurkwood</span></h2> <p>The southern verge of the Lurkwood is safe enough to attract woodcutters, trappers, and hunters from Mirabar, Xantharl's Keep, and Longsaddle, but there's really no corner safe from the Uthgardt tribes that hunt here (primarily Black Raven and Thunderbeast barbarians).

It's a dirty dive with filthy streets, squat buildings, ramshackle docks, creaky old longships, and crass pirates thinly disguised as sea traders. Rising above the fog and the stench is the Hosttower of the Arcane, home of a league of greedy, power-hungry wizards called the Arcane Brotherhood. Their ghastly tower branches into multiple thinner spires at the top. From a distance, the Hosttower might be mistaken for a giant, leafless tree. To those who have the misfortune of seeing it up close, it looks like a clawed hand bursting out of the ground, each of its fingers a tower with many peering windows.</p><p>Five High Captains rule the city. Each one is a glorified pirate lord who controls a fleet of longships. The five fleets serve many purposes: they defend Luskan against seafaring barbarians and other enemies, they conduct legitimate sea trade up and down the Sword Coast, and they raid and plunder the island kingdoms to the west (and the occasional settlement on the Sword Coast). The High Captains have no influence over the actions of the Arcane Brotherhood, nor is it apparent that the wizards have any allegiance to Luskan.</p><p>Luskan's best-kept secret is that the High Captains are under the sway of Jarlaxle Baenre, the leader of a clandestine brotherhood of drow mercenaries and rogues called Bregan D'aerthe. Jarlaxle is a master schemer (and a master of disguise) who would like to bring Luskan into the Lords' Alliance, but the City of Sails has such an unsavory reputation and so little to offer that most alliance members won't allow it. That doesn't stop Jarlaxle from trying, especially now that the alliance has lost two members: Everlund and Sundabar.</p><p>Characters approaching Luskan for the first time see a thick black cloud of smoke rising from the harbor. The smoke billows out of a frost giant greatship (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000007#frost-giants]{Svardborg: General Features}\" sidebar in chapter 7, \"Berg of the Frost Giants\") that blew into port and rammed several longships, sinking them before a group of wizards emerged from the Hosttower of the Arcane and set the ship ablaze with a flurry of @spell[fireball] spells. The wizards have since returned to their monstrous tower, and the High Captains are waiting for the ship to stop burning before they board and search it. (Given the size of the ship, that could take a while.) Several charred frost giant corpses float facedown in the frigid water around the burning wreck, and the greatship's deck is strewn with other dead giants.</p><p>For a map of Luskan and more information about it, see the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#SCAG\">Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide</a>.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Maelstrom\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"495\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Maelstrom</span></h2> <p>The daughters of @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} reside in this undersea fortress, which stands amid reefs and barnacle-covered shipwrecks in the depths of the Trackless Sea.

Countless adventurers have perished in the Mere, drawn by true tales of ruined castles half-sunk in the mire. These once noble estates are now home to lizardfolk, undead, and worse. The greatest threats to would-be treasure hunters are the ancient black dragon twins Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor.

The mines of Mirabar yield up vast quantities of most known metals and gemstones. Working mines of any significance are heavily fortified.

Defenders can fire arrows down from atop the walls, or, in winter, pour water down them to make ice slides. There is no shortage of stone and weaponry. Even the docks have battlements and fortifications.</p><p>Visitors to Mirabar often wonder why they don't see more dwarves, as humans make up the majority of the city's surface dwellers. Another city lies just below the surface, and that place is dominated by dwarves. Underground, Mirabar is a city of lit residential caverns, superheated forges, foundries that operate day and night, and tunnels leading to the mines.</p><p>Mirabar's marchion, Selin Ramur (LN male Damaran human @UUID[Actor.XgAjpoJSv5Bqo6gO]{noble}), meets with the other members of the Lords' Alliance to ensure that Mirabar's interests aren't ignored. While the marchion handles foreign policy, true power within the city rests with the Council of Sparkling Stones, a group of dwarf elders that manages the city's security and decides where the output of Mirabar's mines are sold. The city's defense falls to the Axe of Mirabar, a well-armed garrison. All members of the Axe of Mirabar are shield dwarves.

Neverember, who was courted and ultimately betrayed by sycophantic nobles and guildmasters in Waterdeep, doesn't want a repeat of those events in Neverwinter.

In its heyday, Noanar's Hold hosted wild hunts that attracted the wealthiest nobles and merchants of the North. Some who ventured to Noanar's Hold never returned, spurring dark rumors that the five Hunt Lords who ruled Noanar's Hold were arranging wanton slaughters to amuse their guests and even allowing their guests to hunt one another. The place was shunned, and the village fell on hard times. Any character who has proficiency in the &amp;Reference[skill=History] skill can recall these dark rumors with a successful [[/save ability=int dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=History]) check. A successful check also confirms that the Hunt Lords were human.</p><p>As it happens, the rumors are true. The Hunt Lords played all sorts of terrible games at the expense of their wealthy employers. A century and a half ago, to escape their inevitable deaths, the Hunt Lords forged a pact with Orcus, who transformed them into five @UUID[Actor.yWC9DGzBKfMjUsNk]{wights}. Necromancers in the demon lord's service helped the Hunt Lords turn the inanimate bones of their long-dead horses into five animated @UUID[Actor.b0yqyenw7RI1CE8D]{warhorse skeletons}. Every night, after sunset, the Hunt Lords ride out on their skeletal steeds to patrol the lands around Noanar's Hold, looking for worthy prey to hunt. They always return to their keep before sunrise the following morning. They have no interest in harming the local villagers, whom they view as their subjects. The villagers are well aware of the Hunt Lords' escapades, but Noanar's Hold is so isolated that few others know that the Hunt Lords still exist. A handful of villagers have moved away from Noanar's Hold over the years, but most are too frightened to flee, believing the rumors (although they are false) that the Hunt Lords track down and kill villagers who try to leave. Today, residents of Noanar's Hold rarely stray far from their homes. They don't speak of the Hunt Lords, nor do they warn visitors away. Fearing the Hunt Lords' wrath, they keep to themselves and say little or nothing about their undead masters.</p><p>The village's once-famous hunting lodge, the White Hart Inn, stands amid low stone cottages and stables. The creaky building is well maintained on the inside, offering a bit of grandeur in an otherwise rustic setting. The innkeeper is a courteous little man named Avgar Filroy (N male Chondathan human @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}), who has permanent unseen servants to help with cleaning. He is a little delusional and speaks of the Hunt Lords as if they are still alive, even though he has seen evidence to the contrary. He says the Hunt Lords are retired and don't wish to be disturbed, and he warns guests to stay in the lodge at night, claiming the land around Noanar's Hold is haunted by the spirits of dead hunters.</p><p>Characters who seek an audience with the Hunt Lords must first speak to Amrath Mulnobar (NE male shield dwarf @UUID[Actor.iDlg4HChHwAG5ADN]{veteran}), the castellan of the Hunt Lords' keep. Amrath has served the Hunt Lords for more than two centuries, dating back to when they were still alive. Now he's a gray-bearded curmudgeon who hangs about the dark halls of the keep like a bad smell. The keep had a small garrison once, but only Amrath remains.</p><p>The keep is nestled among old pine trees on a hilltop overlooking the sleepy village. The building has three stories, corner turrets, and rooftop battlements. One of the turret rooftops has collapsed, leaving a gaping hole through which birds and other creatures can enter. All the windows are bricked up, and the heavy oaken doors on the ground floor are barred from within. Forcing them open requires a successful [[/save ability=str dc=27]] check. If the characters knock on these doors, Amrath arrives a minute later, opens an iron slit in the door at dwarf's-eye level, and demands to know what they want. The dwarf doesn't open the doors unless the characters are delivering new saddles for his masters' steeds (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000002#triboar-quests]{Narth Tezrin's Quest}\" section in chapter 2). Amrath allows the characters to place the saddles in the entrance foyer, then quickly tries to usher them out.</p><p>The Hunt Lords lurk in a dusty ground-floor banquet hall, slumped in chairs around a cobweb-draped dining table. They spend their days reminiscing about the \"good old times\" and attack any creature other than Amrath who disturbs them. Behind their chairs are piles of horse bones. As a bonus action on its turn, a Hunt Lord can command the nearest pile of bones to rise up and become a warhorse skeleton under its command.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Treasure\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"517\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></h3> <p>At the back of the Hunt Lords' banquet hall is a locked treasure chest.

The inn gets its name from an incident involving a beheaded troll that wandered into village, caught fire, and nearly burned down the establishment.

The upper tier is shaped like a sky pony (a pegasus), though the form of this feature is readily apparent only from the air. A round, 15-foot-diameter boulder planted firmly in the ground in the northeastern part of the area represents the eye of the sky pony. The boulder is covered with line engravings chiseled by an unknown hand, and it's this stone that the spirit mound's name refers to. The Sky Ponies use the stone as an altar, and Sky Pony shamans believe they can commune with Uthgar simply by touching the boulder while its surface is bathed in the light of the full moon.</p><p>A swift but shallow stream of sparkling, fresh water encircles the spirit mound like a moat, although it is by no means defensive in nature. Overlooking the stream at the northeast and southwest ends of the plateau are unpainted totem poles, the tops of which are carved to look like sky ponies with spread wings.

There, the followers of Uthgar buried both halves of a giant relic: a colorfully painted porcelain mask crafted long ago for a cloud giant. The mask is nonmagical, and each half weighs 20 pounds.

Dragons also assault farms and settlements from time to time.</p><p>The War of the Silver Marches exacted such a heavy toll—including the destruction and occupation of Sundabar—that the final victory over the orcs felt hollow.

A @spell[detect magic] spell cast within range of the tree reveals an aura of necromancy magic emanating from underneath it. To reach the relic, characters must dig under the tree and hack away at its roots.

It enters the world from the Border Ethereal and attacks any trespassers that it sees, first using its Horrifying Visage action, and then its Possession and Withering Touch. If it succeeds in possessing a creature, the ghost uses the host body to attack other trespassers. If the ghost drops to 0 hit points, it vanishes with a furious scream.</p><p>In the round after the ghost is defeated, on what would be its initiative count, the @UUID[Actor.1aSWthW54pxvXzJ5]{ghost} of another chieftain appears next to the tree. This process continues until four Uthgardt ghosts have been defeated.</p><p>The ghosts don't attack members of the Blue Bear tribe. Any character dressed as a Blue Bear warrior or shaman can fool a ghost with a successful [[/save ability=cha dc=12]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Deception]) check. Although they can speak Bothii (the Uthgardt language), the dead Uthgardt chieftains have no inclination to communicate with trespassers, and they don't know why they've been denied a place at Uthgar's side in the afterlife. Any ghosts that are defeated re-form at midnight and can reappear thereafter. If the frost giant skull is removed from its resting place under the tree, the Uthgardt spirits are laid to rest and the ghosts don't reappear.</p><p>The oak tree has AC 15, 100 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to psychic damage. Attacking or destroying it has no effect on a ghost that has already manifested.

Some hunting lodges and keeps owned by wealthy Waterdhavians and adventurers remain—and in recent years have become homes to bandits and monsters. Those who excavate the Sumber Hills for building stone and gravel often talk of finding gemstones and rich veins of ore in the hills—but for the most part, these persistent tales have never been anything but fiction.</p><p>For a map of the Sumber Hills and descriptions of various locations in and around the area, see the adventure <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#PotA\">Princes of the Apocalypse</a>.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Sundabar\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"569\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sundabar</span></h2> <p>Mirabar's sister-city is a shattered ruin.

The castle is without adornment; only crenellations and arrow slits break its solid face of stone.

Its current occupants are the shield dwarves of the Stoneshaft clan. They refer to the castle as Stoneshaft Hold. The Stoneshaft dwarves are reclusive and secretive, yet they are interested to hear what's afoot in Waterdeep, for they suspect the Margaster family is plotting to attack the fortress and reclaim its ancestral holding.</p><p>Travelers are free to visit Thornhold, up to a point.

The hulking yet friendly proprietor, Arzastra (LG female @UUID[Actor.sylwbNBlahzDminr]{half-ogre}), recently took pity on a coinless shield dwarf adventurer named Larg and is paying him a few coppers to clean the stables.</p><p>\"Larg\" told Arzastra that he and his adventuring companions were caught in an avalanche while hunting a red dragon in the Valley of Khedrun, and only he survived. The story is a fabrication, but Arzastra bought it. The shifty dwarf is actually a wanted criminal named Worvil \"@UUID[Actor.iT53Zqg0fmjvTwUm]{the Weevil}\" Forkbeard. The characters might know of him from talking to certain NPCs (such as @UUID[Actor.Gqnc5DfD5jfW0pu3]{Sir Baric Nylef} in Bryn Shander or @UUID[Actor.5QwRNsmo024Bujwf]{Darz Helgar} in Triboar), or from a wanted poster in Longsaddle. @UUID[Actor.iT53Zqg0fmjvTwUm]{The Weevil} can be found cleaning the inn's stables during the day or drinking in a private, plainly furnished guest bedroom on the upper floor of the inn at night. @UUID[Actor.iT53Zqg0fmjvTwUm]{The Weevil} avoids making eye contact with strangers.

(Many goblins are killed as their bodies are flung against the keep by the huckers.) During the uproar, any character who succeeds on a [[/save ability=wis dc=20]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Insight]) check realizes that the siege is a ruse to draw attention away from the village's east gate, where the real attack is taking place.</p><p>A while back, Worvil Forkbeard told a few friends that he needed a place to hide and planned to lie low in Xantharl's Keep. One of his friends betrayed that confidence to the frost giant now attacking the keep, who is named Kaltivar. The giant intends to collect on the 5,000 gp reward being offered for the dwarf's capture and is using the goblinoids and ogres as a distraction to help him bag the dwarf.

The Evermoor Way cuts through the heart of Yartar, connecting the city's western and eastern gates. East of the city, the trade road becomes a gravel trail.</p><p>Yartar is prosperous and becoming increasingly crowded. Some of its old buildings have been torn down and taller ones built—four stories high, in some cases.</p><p>Because the city is a major river port, Yartar's elected leader is called a Waterbaron. The current Waterbaron is Nestra Ruthiol (LE female Tethyrian human @UUID[Actor.XgAjpoJSv5Bqo6gO]{noble}), a shrewd, vindictive woman in her late fifties. Yartar is a member of the Lords' Alliance, and Ruthiol considers that relationship vital to her city's survival and prosperity. She knows that the Harpers and the Zhentarim are well established in the city, but her path crosses with theirs only when the well-being of Yartarrans is threatened. Both factions have infiltrated the local thieves' guild, the all-female Hand of Yartar.</p><p>Characters who obtain Tamalin Zoar's letter of recommendation (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000003#calling-horns]{Calling Horns}\" section) can present it to a member of the Hand of Yartar and gain the guild's assistance in any of the following ways:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">If the characters are looking for an individual in the city whose location isn't well known, the Hand of Yartar can reliably track down that person in [[/r 4d6]] hours.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">If the characters need to sell loot, the Hand of Yartar can find (not necessarily honest) buyers for them.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">If the characters come to Yartar seeking an expeditious means of travel, the Hand of Yartar tells them about a not-so-secret @spell[teleportation circle] guarded by a wizard named Kolbaz (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000003#inner-circles]{Inner Circles}\" section at the end of this chapter).</li></ul><p>The greatest threat facing Yartar is the Kraken Society (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000000#factions-in-the-north]{Factions in the North}\" section in the introduction), which is trying to seize control of the city from within and turn it into a stronghold. One of Yartar's nobles is a Kraken Society member named @UUID[Actor.mBIsG43an4ob0KDa]{Khaspere Drylund}. Lord Drylund is eager to displace Ruthiol as the city's Waterbaron. He can't have Ruthiol eliminated, however, until he has gathered enough support to guarantee victory in the election to determine her successor. He hopes to win votes by identifying and bribing (or blackmailing) Yartar's most corruptible officials, and by hosting extravagant parties aboard his private, splendidly decorated riverboat.

The crypt has two levels, and the name Myrna is inscribed above its entrance (which is sealed with an @spell[arcane lock] spell). The topmost level is the crypt itself, which contains a stone sarcophagus watched over by a @UUID[Actor.iyGRF6JrXgwhygVE]{shield guardian} that is trained to lift the lid whenever someone speaks the name Myrna aloud. The sarcophagus contains a stone staircase leading down to a magically lit room. The circle is on the floor of this chamber, which also includes a small study alcove and a cot for its attending mage, a pale wisp of a girl named Thestryl Mellardin (LG female Chondathan human @UUID[Actor.sMYXCW2K2ptMY1Wb]{mage}).

Behind the dilapidated building is a 40-foot-square garden patio enclosed by an 8-foot-high wall of ivy-covered stone. A @spell[hallucinatory terrain] spell conceals not only the @spell[teleportation circle] inscribed in the middle of the patio but also the broken benches, weed-infested flowerbeds, and shattered statuary that surround the circle. While the @spell[hallucinatory terrain] spell is in effect, the garden looks as it did in its heyday, with statues of frolicking dryads and satyrs situated among the flowers and stone benches. A cantankerous old Harper named Kolbaz (NG male Calishite human @UUID[Actor.sMYXCW2K2ptMY1Wb]{mage}) dwells in the villa and renews the @spell[hallucinatory terrain] spell every day at highsun (he has that spell prepared instead of @spell[ice storm]).

That's the best time to use this encounter.</p><p>Fate brings the characters into contact with @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} the Grim, a legendary good-aligned frost giant. In taverns throughout the North, he is known as a monster to some and a hero to others. In Waterdeep, he's remembered as the largest member of Force Grey, a notoriously destructive adventuring company that came to the city's defense on more than one occasion. Believed to be hundreds of years old, @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} wanders the wilderness with greataxe in hand, seeking to lay low his evil giant brethren.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag}'s history isn't important to this adventure, and he doesn't like to talk about his past. What's important is that he knows that the ordning has been broken, that the storm giants no longer have the power to keep the smaller giants in check, and that @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} has gone missing. He aims to protect the North from the depredations of evil giants while seeking out adventurers who share this goal. By the time the characters meet him, he has already slaughtered a few giants.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} looks like a typical frost giant except that he's clad in plate armor and wears the skull of a white dragon as a helm. His jagged axe also looks quite formidable. He's a giant of few words who prefers to let his actions do his talking. When he does speak outside of combat, he comes across as surprisingly calm and soft-spoken. While swinging his axe in battle, however, he bellows and laughs like a berserker. In the company of small adventurers, he tries not to dominate social situations or make too many decisions for them, because he knows how fragile and inflated their egos can be.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} knows the North well and has no chance of becoming lost in its wilderness. He's sensitive to the fact that many small folk have a freshly rekindled fear of giants striding into their settlements. As a result, if the characters visit a settlement while @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} is with them, he prefers to remain unseen on the outskirts. The exception is Waterdeep; he considers that city his home and has no qualms about entering it, gently brushing aside guards who stand in his way.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} is a @UUID[Actor.0e4VCY9QHJ0DVAAa]{frost giant}, with the following changes:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">His alignment is chaotic good.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">He has 204 hit points and wears a suit of @UUID[Item.FT5aRZY958ot8pnx]{+3 plate armor} that resizes to fit its wearer.

He has a +11 bonus to hit with the axe, which deals 26 ([[/r 3d12 + 7]]) slashing damage on a hit, or 39 ([[/r 5d12 + 7]]) slashing damage if the target is human.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">His challenge rating is 9 (5,000 XP).</li></ul><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Harshnag's Idea\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"616\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Harshnag's Idea</span></h3> <p>Although he has been happy to wander the North, slaughtering his fellow giants at every turn, @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} now thinks it might be time to consult with a higher authority. He knows the location of a mountain temple built by his ancient ancestors under the Spine of the World. He calls it the Eye of the All-Father. According to giant legend, the temple contains a divine oracle. @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} offers to lead the characters to the temple so that they can consult with this oracle and learn how best to end the giants' threat to the North.</p><p>If the characters agree to follow @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag}, he leads them from their present location to the Valley of Khedrun. From there, he guides them along a snowy path that climbs up the frozen mountains to the temple's entrance (see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000004#journey-to-the-eye]{Journey to the Eye}\" section at the start of chapter 4). Depending on where the characters are when @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} meets them, the journey to the temple might be long and perilous; use the Random Wilderness Encounters table to make the trip a memorable one.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Harshnag in Play\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"617\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Harshnag in Play</span></h3> <p>@UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} tries not to dominate combat if it means making his smaller compatriots feel inferior. He doesn't want to be seen as a showoff. He can reduce his combat effectiveness in the following ways:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">He makes one attack on his turn instead of two.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">He uses the @action[Help] action to aid a character's next attack against a foe (see the action's description in <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,8\">chapter 9</a> of the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a>).</li><li class=\"rd__li\">He does nothing on his turn except taunt an enemy who might otherwise attack a character.

With a successful [[/save ability=wis dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Survival]) check, a character can determine that the tracks are those of eight humans. These tracks were made by the Uthgardt barbarians in @UUID[.0000000000000004#4.-giant-doors]{area 4}.</p><p>The causeway ends before a stone dome carved from the mountainside. Six 30-foot-tall stone pillars support the dome, which is in no danger of collapse, even if the pillars were to be toppled. Each pillar is carved with a wraparound bas-relief. From north to south, the pillars depict the following scenes:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">A hill giant lifting a rock above its head</li><li class=\"rd__li\">A frost giant chopping down a great pine</li><li class=\"rd__li\">A cloud giant flying among birds in the sky</li><li class=\"rd__li\">A flying storm giant hurling lightning bolts at a ship</li><li class=\"rd__li\">A stone giant climbing a mountain</li><li class=\"rd__li\">A fire giant with chained dwarf prisoners in a cavern</li></ul><p>At the back of the dome, a 40-foot-wide, 40-foot-high hallway heads into the mountain.

Door hinges and handles are made of wrought iron, and the handles are 12 feet off the floor. A Huge giant has no trouble opening doors that aren't frozen shut. A smaller creature can try to open a door if that creature can reach the door's handle and unlatch it. While the handle is unlatched, a creature must use an action to push or pull on the heavy door, opening it with a successful [[/save ability=str dc=12]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check.

Each one holds an iron sconce that radiates a faint aura of conjuration magic under the scrutiny of a @spell[detect magic] spell. Touching a sconce with an open flame causes a spectral fire to materialize above the sconce. This flame sheds light and heat like a normal torch, and it burns until smothered. If a sconce is taken from its niche, it loses its magic forever.

The chieftain is secretly hoping to use this opportunity as an excuse to plunder the temple of its treasures, but his berserkers have been unable to get through these doors. The Uthgardt and their leader are hostile toward anyone who isn't a member of their tribe, and they fight to the death.

Seven enormous statues dominate the room. The largest of them is an 80-foot-tall robed giant, his arms outstretched and his face hidden beneath a stony cowl, facing a glowing archway in the east wall. Kneeling in rows to each side of this statue are six statues half its size, each impressive in its own right and depicting a paragon of a type of giant: hill, stone, frost, fire, cloud, and storm. These smaller statues face the bigger one in the room's center. In their outstretched arms, five of the giants hold weapons—gifts for their All-Father.

Six different runes are carved into it, each one inlaid with mithral, and a glowing mist fills the arch. Niches in the walls on either side of it contain empty, ice-covered sconces made of iron.</p></div><p>The double doors that lead to this chamber are 30 feet tall and open into the room. The double doors leading to areas 4 and 7 are covered with a 4-inch-thick layer of ice that must be chipped away or melted before the doors can be pulled open from this side (either physically or with the aid of knock spells or a chime of opening). A @spell[fireball] spell produces enough heat to melt the ice on one set of doors. Otherwise, it takes a character using a weapon, a pick, or a similar tool 1 hour to chip away the ice covering one set of doors, or 1 hour to melt the ice with a torch. Multiple characters working together to remove the ice shorten the time proportionately.</p><p>Characters who search the temple for secret doors and succeed on a [[/save ability=wis dc=20]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Perception]) check find two secret doors behind the frost that covers the west wall.

Each secret door requires a successful [[/save ability=str dc=20]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check to open or close.</p><p>The iron sconces are bolted to their niches and radiate faint auras of conjuration magic under the scrutiny of a @spell[detect magic] spell. Touching a sconce with an open flame causes a spectral fire to appear above the sconce. This flame sheds light and heat like a normal torch, and it burns until smothered.

Five of these statues grasp giant-sized weapons that can be removed. Thrym's weapon is missing and can be found in @UUID[.0000000000000004#7.-feast-hall]{area 7}. Removing any of these weapons from the dungeon causes it to vanish and reappear in the appropriate statue's grasp. If the statue is destroyed, the weapon has nowhere to return to and disappears. The table shows which statue holds which weapon, as well as the weight of each weapon and the archway rune associated with each weapon (see \"Archway and Runes\").</p><p>Each statue has AC 20, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The statue of Annam has 750 hit points; the others have 250 hit points each.

The characters have to figure out which rune is which through trial and error, or with the aid of magic such as the @spell[divination] spell. A character who has proficiency in the &amp;Reference[skill=Arcana] skill can tell that the runes are magical, but not what the runes mean. @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} is familiar with the ise rune and can identify it; the other runes are unknown to him. @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}, @UUID[Actor.osMHdhwQplUH432a]{Klauth}, @UUID[Actor.WGtSRFMDx8MO8EcC]{Claugiyliamatar}, and most other ancient dragons know all of these runes by name and appearance.</p><p>The mist in the archway dimly illuminates the temple. A @spell[detect magic] spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the archway, but nothing happens when something enters the mist While the archway is inactive, cold rock wall can be felt beyond the churning mist.</p><p>The archway is a portal that connects the temple to the divine oracle (@UUID[.0000000000000004#11.-eye-of-annam]{area 11}), allowing instantaneous two-way travel once it is activated. To activate the portal, a giant of the hill, stone, frost, fire, cloud, or storm variety (or a creature polymorphed into one of these forms) must take a weapon from one of the statues of the six lesser giant gods and touch it to the appropriate rune on the archway. The wielder must use the weapon belonging to the god that corresponds to the wielder's physical form; for example, @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} (a frost giant) can activate the portal only by using Thrym's steel greataxe, and only by touching it to the ise (frost) rune. As soon as the archway activates, the weapon vanishes and reappears in the hands of the statue it came from, unless that statue has been destroyed, in which case the weapon disappears.</p><p>Touching a rune with the wrong weapon triggers a spell effect, as described in the Rune Traps table.

The hall is inclined at a slight angle, so that the floor in the north end of the hall is higher than in the south end. The slope isn't so great that the frost on the floor presents a hazard. Fourteen 30-foot-tall archways spaced along the west and east walls lead to 60-foot-square chambers furnished with frost-covered stone couches that serve as beds. Some of these beds have tattered furs atop them. A fissure in the back wall of the center room on the west side leads to a network of natural tunnels (@UUID[.0000000000000004#9.-ice-spider-tunnels]{area 9}).</p><p>This hallway contains a magical trap, and a @spell[detect magic] spell can reveal certain clues, as described in areas 8A and 8B.

It triggers even if they fly over or move invisibly through that area. @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} is unaware of this trap and can't warn the party about it.</p><p>When the trap activates, walls of stone (created by @spell[wall of stone] spells) seal off the archways along the west and east walls. When that happens, all creatures in the hallway or the adjacent rooms must roll initiative. On initiative count 15, a 40-foot-diameter sphere of solid granite phases out of the north wall at @UUID[.0000000000000004#8c.-stone-sphere]{area 8C} and rolls southward down the corridor.

Each round thereafter on initiative count 15, the statue moves 20 feet northward, rolling the sphere ahead of it. The statue and sphere move slowly enough that creatures can easily get out of the way. When the statue reaches the north end of the hallway, it pushes the sphere back into the wall (the sphere melds with the stone as it comes into contact with it).

In recent years, they have become a haunt for ice spiders. Ice spiders have red eyes and white fur covering their bodies, and they weave liquid webs that crystallize quickly, forming frosty sheets and icy cocoons.</p><p>The tunnels are 10-foot-high, 5-foot-wide cracks in the mountain rock (too narrow for @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag}).

A thin layer of frost coats the walls, floor, and ceiling throughout.</p><p>The westernmost tunnel branch opens high upon the mountainside. The slope is so steep that a creature falling from this height would tumble almost 400 feet down the mountainside before landing on any sort of ledge.

The first one contains the exsanguinated corpse of a mountain goat. The second one holds a dead shield dwarf prospector wearing a tattered fur cloak and clutching a miner's pick close to his chest. The third one contains a living Uthgardt barbarian of the Great Worm tribe named @UUID[Actor.YWM9U0IHOYYDWz9s]{Noori}, a @UUID[Actor.30Q17KvaUmYKG24U]{berserker} with the following changes:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">Her alignment is chaotic evil.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">She has 0 hit points and is &amp;Reference[condition=unconscious] but stable.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">She has the following skills: &amp;Reference[skill=Stealth] +3, &amp;Reference[skill=Survival] +2.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">She speaks Bothii (the Uthgardt language) and Common.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">She is unarmed, having lost her greataxe.

Eye of Annam</span></h2> <p>This room lies deep within the mountain, farther from the temple than the map suggests. The contents of this room—including any creatures within it—are hidden from divination magic. They can't be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. No doors or passages lead to or from the room. The characters arrive here by way of the teleportation archway in the temple. They can leave the same way, as long as the archway is still active (see @UUID[.0000000000000004#6.-annams-temple]{area 6}). Otherwise, they are stranded here unless they have some way to teleport out.</p><p>When the characters pass through the archway, read:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"></span></span><p>Beyond the thundering archway lies a hexagonal chamber whose walls rise 50 feet before tapering to a 90-foot-high apex. Standing in each corner of the room is a life-size statue of a giant holding up a heavy, iron lantern with one raised arm. Each type of giant is represented: hill, stone, frost, fire, cloud, and storm. A cold, magical light radiates from each lantern, illuminating a giant corpse lying on the floor beneath a shroud of frost in the middle of the room. The corpse looks like it has been here for some time, preserved by the cold. Next to the body rests a giant, frost-covered morningstar.</p></div><p>This chamber allows communion with a divine proxy of Annam the All-Father. It's called the Eye of Annam because ancient giants thought the chamber enabled them to gain wisdom from him directly. Casting @spell[detect magic] reveals an aura of divination magic in the room.</p><p>The corpse belongs to a @UUID[Actor.GMZbiNXD6tFs3TkT]{young cloud giant} named Eigeron, whose father, Blagothkus, betrayed and murdered him. If the characters disturb Eigeron's body or come within 10 feet of it, the giant's ghost rises up from the corpse (see \"@UUID[Actor.0LpjVu38BHEjFnyP]{Eigeron's Ghost}\").</p><p>The dead giant wears a golden breastplate (see \"Treasure\"). His morningstar is nonmagical and made for a Huge creature. Characters close enough to touch the cloud giant's corpse or the morningstar notice a rune-inscribed circle carved into the floor, obscured by frost (see the \"Words of the Divine Oracle\" section).</p><p>The teleportation archway looks much the same as it does when viewed from @UUID[.0000000000000004#6.-annams-temple]{area 6}, except it bears no runes, and it can't be activated from this side. Characters who study the arch and succeed on a [[/save ability=int dc=17]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Arcana]) check can sense that the archway will remain open for a short time only, perhaps as long as an hour.</p><p>The statues are impressive and harmless. The lights in their lanterns are created by @spell[continual flame] spells.</p><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/059-skt04-03.webp\"/>\n</div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Eigeron's Ghost\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"661\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Eigeron's Ghost</span></h3> <p>Like many giants before them, Eigeron and his father, Blagothkus, came to the Eye of Annam seeking wisdom. The divine oracle told them that a great upheaval would upset the balance of power in the world, giving all giants the opportunity to win the respect of their gods and bring glory to their race. The oracle told Blagothkus outright that he could never impress the gods enough to earn their favor, then urged Eigeron to step out from beneath his father's \"dark shadow.\" Blagothkus was overcome with despair and envy. A terrible fight between father and son ensued, in which Blagothkus slew Eigeron. Blagothkus then retired to his castle to mourn.</p><p>Eigeron manifests as the spirit of a cloud giant. He wants to know why the characters have come and tries to be helpful. He knows how the oracle works and can explain what the characters must say to contact it (see \"Words of the Divine Oracle\"). After he gives this information, he asks the characters to avenge his death by killing his evil father, Blagothkus (see \"Development\").</p><p>If the party attacks the ghost, it fights back.

Characters who consult with a member of the Surveyors', Map &amp; Chartmakers' Guild in Waterdeep or any learned sage in Everlund or Silverymoon can procure a map for 100 gp that shows Parnast's location. The village lies between the Graypeak Mountains and the Weathercote Forest, near the western edge of the desert of Anauroch. If they travel to Parnast, the characters see Blagothkus's flying castle hovering nearby, its towers casting long shadows over the village.</p><p>What happens if the characters decide to pursue Blagothkus is beyond the scope of this adventure. Statistics for the evil cloud giant and detailed plans of his flying castle are provided in the <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> adventure. If the characters are intent on confronting Blagothkus, you can run the final chapter of that adventure, which is an appropriate challenge for a party of 7th-level adventurers. Also see the information about Blagothkus presented in the \"@UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000014#tyranny-of-dragons]{Tyranny of Dragons}\" section in appendix A of this book.</p></div></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Words of the Oracle\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"664\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Words of the Oracle</span></h1> <p>Etched into the floor of @UUID[.0000000000000004#11.-eye-of-annam]{area 11} and hidden under a thin layer of frost is a 20-foot-diameter, mithral-inlaid circle inscribed with the kong (king) rune (see \"@UUID[.0000000000000000#the-ordning]{Giant Runes}\" in the Introduction) and the words \"Ask Your Question and Know Truth\" in Dethek, the Dwarvish script.

Any creature in the circle that asks a question receives a truthful, thundering answer in the Giant tongue (even if the question was asked in another language).

Characters can fly up to the ship if they have the means to do so. If they decline to board the vessel, the crew signals for them to come aboard. If they still decline, the airship lands so that the dragon cultists can reveal who sent them and why.</p><p>The ship's crew consists of eight members of the Cult of the Dragon (NE male and female human @UUID[Actor.5Ecc3Go87qYB3Ce4]{cultists} of various ethnicities), all wearing black leather armor and black leather masks. The cultists are a humorless but resolute bunch. Their names are Delsephine, Nyzroth, Brassik, Laz, Oriskus, Perella, Tralt, and Zalthia. Delsephine is their leader. Four are on duty at any time (two to crew the ship and two standing watch) while the others rest. A party member who observes one or more cultists operating the airship for an entire day can, with a successful [[/save ability=int dc=15]] check, learn enough about the ship's operation to take the place of a cultist on the crew. For their part, the cultists are willing to crew the vessel so that the characters can focus on navigation, as well as loading, aiming, and firing the onboard weapons.</p><p>The cultists' orders are to steer the ship as the characters direct and help the characters defend it. They don't assist the characters otherwise and avoid putting themselves in harm's way. Characters can leave the cultists behind if they wish, but the cultists are quick to point out that the characters will find it impossible to operate the ship on their own. @UUID[Actor.osMHdhwQplUH432a]{Klauth} doesn't care what becomes of the cultists once the airship is delivered to the party, nor does he care exactly what the characters do with the airship once it comes into their possession.

Atop the balloon is a crow's nest that is reached by crawling up the ropes on the outside of the balloon. Crawling up the ropes requires a [[/save ability=str dc=10]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) or Dexterity (&amp;Reference[skill=Acrobatics]) check. If the check fails, no progress is made; if the check fails by 5 or more, the creature falls.</p><p>The balloon is roped to a gondola that has been fitted with steel runners. The airship has a speed of 8 miles per hour while skiing across ice or snow or flying in the air. A strong headwind reduces the ship's speed to 4 mph, while a strong tailwind increases its speed to 12 mph. By changing altitude, the ship can use air currents to move in a particular direction. A propeller aft of the gondola thrusts the ship forward and can also be pivoted. The hull of the gondola is watertight and buoyant in water, and the propeller can push it across water.</p><p>The airship can hold up to 1 ton of cargo and requires a crew of two, one to operate the propeller and one to operate the furnace. If the ship has fewer than two crew members on duty, its speed can't be controlled, and it moves in a random direction, carried by the wind, until control is regained or until it collides with something.</p><p>The gondola and the balloon are separate targets. The gondola has AC 13, 250 hit points, and a damage threshold of 10. The balloon has AC 11 and 50 hit points. Both have immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the balloon drops to 0 hit points, it bursts, and the ship loses the ability to fly. While the balloon or gondola has at least 1 hit point, it can be repaired. Repairing 1 hit point of damage to either the balloon or the gondola requires 1 day and costs 20 gp. (@spell[Mending] spells can repair superficial damage but can't restore hit points.)</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Airship Locations\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"679\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Airship Locations</span></h2> <p>The following locations are identified on map 4.3.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"1.

Furnace</span></h3> <p>In the middle of the upper deck is a 10-foot-tall, cylindrical bronze furnace with a @UUID[Actor.BIkdEiWvIj6ccg4A]{fire elemental} magically trapped inside it. A narrow hatch in the front of the furnace has a small grill through which the elemental can be seen, and the heat pouring out through the grill helps keep the deck crew warm on cold days and nights. An iron wheel on the starboard side of the furnace opens and closes a bronze valve at the top of the cylinder, which has the effect of increasing or reducing the size of the fire spilling out of the furnace. The more heat that is allowed to fill the balloon, the higher the ship can rise.</p><p>Opening the hatch or the valve doesn't release the fire elemental, but destroying the furnace does, as does successfully casting @spell[dispel magic] (DC <span class=\"rd__dc\">19</span>) on it. The furnace has AC 15, 30 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. The fire elemental goes berserk if released, attacking all other creatures it sees. Inside or outside the furnace, it can be banished using a @spell[banishment] spell or similar magic, or trapped inside an @UUID[Item.UcKu1vYTkUNWGIyC]{iron flask} or a similar device. If the furnace is destroyed or the elemental released from within it, the air inside the balloon cools, causing the airship to descend at a rate of 10 feet per round.</p><p>While the furnace chamber is intact, a fire elemental under the control of another creature can be trapped in the furnace, until it is released as described above. The furnace can contain only one fire elemental at a time.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"2. Harpoon Gun\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"681\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">2. Harpoon Gun</span></h3> <p>A spring-loaded harpoon gun, fashioned from burnished bronze with iron fittings, is bolted to the forward upper deck. It has a 90-degree arc of fire (side to side, as well as up and down). The gun comes with a winch, a 500-foot coil of rope, and ten steel-tipped harpoons. Although it fires harpoons instead of bolts, the gun is considered a ballista (see the \"<a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,8,siege%20equipment,0\">Siege Equipment</a>\" section in chapter 8 of the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>).</p><p>Tying a rope to a harpoon, if desired, takes an action. In addition to dealing 16 ([[/r 3d10]]) piercing damage on a hit, a harpoon impales its target. While impaled, the target can't take any action on its turn other than trying to free itself from the harpoon, which requires a successful [[/save ability=str dc=15]] check. If the check succeeds, the target takes 5 ([[/r 1d10]]) piercing damage as the harpoon is pulled free and is no longer impaled. If a harpoon is attached to the gun by a rope, a creature impaled on that harpoon can't move farther away from the gun or increase its altitude until it frees itself. A creature within reach of the gun's winch can use its action to reel in a harpooned creature, pulling it up to 20 feet closer to the gun.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"3.

Portholes on the landings look out to port and starboard. The porthole windows are latched shut from the inside, and each porthole is wide enough for a Medium creature to squeeze through.</p><p>At the foot of the stairs is a steel hatch bolted shut from the outside, with two horizontal-sliding iron levers in the adjacent wall. One lever is labeled Thrust, the other Direction (in Common). Behind the hatch is a steel-walled compartment that holds a magically bound @UUID[Actor.6z53wFIGWBS3tP70]{air elemental}. The air elemental powers the aft propeller. Moving the Thrust lever to the left opens valves that allow wind from the elemental to spin the propeller. Moving the lever to the right closes the valves, and the propeller stops turning. Moving the Direction lever to the left or right causes the propeller to pivot in that direction, allowing the ship to turn while the propeller is operating. When the Direction lever is centered, the propeller moves the vessel straight ahead. Opening the hatch frees the elemental, whereupon it attacks any creature it sees. Without the air elemental to propel it, the ship can't push itself across ice or snow and, if aloft, it moves in accordance with the prevailing wind.</p><p>Any air elemental under the control of another creature can be commanded to enter the compartment. If the compartment's hatch is then closed and locked, the elemental becomes trapped inside.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"5.

If the characters defeat Guh and obtain her @UUID[Item.zDgKqy8YpOBW8a8o]{conch of teleportation}, they can use it to teleport to Maelstrom, @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton}'s undersea citadel (see chapter 10, \"Hold of the Storm Giants\"). Obtaining the conch is their main goal here. They must be careful not to put the den on alert before eliminating key threats, lest they become overwhelmed by all of Grudd Haug's denizens.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Hill Giants\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"702\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hill Giants</span></h1> <p>Before running this part of the adventure, review the information on hill giants in the Monster Manual. It will help you roleplay the giants in this chapter.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Guh's Gluttony\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"703\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Guh's Gluttony</span></h2> <p>@UUID[Actor.JkP7gg3B5COYQkmu]{Chief Guh} would like hill giants elevated above their traditional betters. But she's no brighter than a typical hill giant, so her plan is anything but inspired. She plans to eat until she grows so enormous that the gods take notice and show her favor. To her, the biggest giant rules.</p><p>Guh's gluttony knows no bounds. She has been feasting for several months and has grown to such a size that she can no longer walk on her own. She spends her time slumped in a wagon with broken axles, surrounded by heaps of stolen loot and crying out for more food.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"The Hunt for Food\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"704\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Hunt for Food</span></h2> <p>@UUID[Actor.JkP7gg3B5COYQkmu]{Chief Guh} has driven away all the other female hill giants in her tribe and taken their husbands as her own. She tasks her many husbands with bringing her food, and she doesn't care how they go about it. Some of her mates form marauding gangs. Others set out on their own, pillaging the countryside for anything edible.</p><p>Farmers who live downriver from Grudd Haug have suffered the most from the giants' depredations. The first inkling of trouble was a sudden drop in the river's water level, caused by the dam-like structure of the hill giant den. Not long thereafter, Guh's husbands and their followers began plundering livestock from riverside farms, stealing trees from orchards, knocking down cottages, and snatching up folk who didn't run fast enough.</p><p>So far, most of the hill giants' activities have been confined to the region of the Dessarin Valley closest to their den, but as food becomes scarce, Guh's husbands are forced to expand their efforts outward. The villages of Beliard, Womford, and Uluvin, as well as caravans traveling the Iron Road between Womford and Uluvin, are all within the hill giants' threat radius. Meanwhile, the female hill giants exiled by Guh have taken to the hills. They crave the return of their husbands, but they are neither strong enough nor shrewd enough to unseat Guh. They might be convinced to help adventurers overthrow her if it means they get to beat their husbands into submission once more. See the \"Old Tower\" section in chapter 3 for an example of a female hill giant outcast.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Grudd Haug\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"705\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Grudd Haug</span></h1> <p>The hill giants' den is called Grudd Haug, which means \"river mound\" in Giant. Resembling a beaver dam, it straddles a river. The lower level of the den is lodged between two rocky outcroppings and made of piled timber packed with clay and mud, with hollow cavities that resemble caves. Above this piled timber foundation is a mud steading (a house made to giant scale) with a log roof. The structure is an impressive feat of engineering, well beyond the ability of hill giants to fabricate on their own. In fact, Grudd Haug's design is the work of hobgoblin and goblin engineers, assembled with the might of hill giant and ogre laborers. East of the steading is a yard enclosed by a 20-foot-high palisade wall made of logs lashed together with thick twine.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Reaching Grudd Haug\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"706\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Reaching Grudd Haug</span></h2> <p>The characters can travel to Grudd Haug (shown on map 5.1) on foot or horseback. They can also guide a raft upstream or downriver to the hill giant den. In either case, you can make the journey more interesting by adding one or more wilderness encounters appropriate for hill terrain (see the Random Wilderness Encounters table in chapter 3). If Moog the hill giant is with the party, see the \"@UUID[.0000000000000003#old-tower]{Old Tower}\" section in chapter 3 for tips on how to roleplay her once she arrives at Grudd Haug.</p><p>If the characters have an airship (see the \"Airship of a Cult\" section in chapter 4), they can land it pretty much anywhere outside Grudd Haug. The hobgoblins in the gong tower (see \"Approaching the Den\") spot the airship if it approaches within 1 mile of the stronghold and sound the alarm, putting the entire den on alert (see \"Denizens\"). If the characters use the airship's weaponry to attack Grudd Haug, the den's defenders are smart enough to take cover behind walls. Defenders armed with weapons that deal piercing damage target the balloon; those that hurl rocks and use weapons that deal bludgeoning damage target the crew.</p><p>The characters might instead approach on a flying mount. They can obtain griffon mounts in Fireshear or hippogriff mounts in Hawk's Nest. Neither settlement is close to Grudd Haug, requiring the characters and their mounts to rest between flights. Characters mounted on hippogriffs can travel 54 miles per day (three 3-hour flights with 1-hour rests in between). Those mounted on griffons can travel 72 miles in the same amount of time. The hobgoblins in the gong tower (see \"Approaching the Den\") spot flying mounts that approach within a quarter mile of the stronghold and sound the alarm, putting the entire den on alert (see \"Denizens\").</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Grudd Haug: General Features\"><h4 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"707\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Grudd Haug: General Features</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span title=\"Page 138\">p138</span></span></span></h4> <p>The following features are common throughout the hill giant den, which reeks of filth.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Ceilings\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"708\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ceilings.</span></span> Unless otherwise noted, interior chambers have 30-foot-high ceilings, with 20-foot-high passages and doorways connecting them.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Climbing\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"709\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Climbing.</span></span> Walls of piled timber have many handholds and footholds and can be climbed with a successful [[/save ability=str dc=10]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check.

Exceptions are noted in the text. Tables, benches, and other room fixtures are typically twice as high, long, and wide as their human-sized equivalents and roughly eight times the weight.

Those who come near the den without taking efforts to conceal themselves are spotted by the hobgoblins in the gong tower (@UUID[.0000000000000005#8.-gong-tower]{area 8}), who ring the gong to sound the alarm. Characters stand a better chance of infiltrating the den if they approach cautiously, taking advantage of the terrain and using darkness, fog, camouflage, or magic to conceal their movement. Regardless of how the characters approach the den, have them make a group Dexterity (&amp;Reference[skill=Stealth]) check contested by the hobgoblins' Wisdom (&amp;Reference[skill=Perception]) check. (Roll once for all the hobgoblins in the tower.) If the characters take precautions, give them advantage on their checks. If they take none, impose disadvantage on their checks.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Denizens\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"714\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Denizens</span></h2> <p>The Grudd Haug Roster table summarizes the locations of the den's inhabitants and indicates how those creatures react when intruders are detected.</p><p>As soon as trespassers are spotted or combat erupts, the entire den goes on alert. As a consequence, adventurers might find themselves fighting several encounters' worth of creatures at once. Grudd Haug's defenders lack a cohesive defense strategy, but they are many.</p><p>If Guh dies, the morale of Grudd Haug's other denizens breaks, and they flee into the wilderness.</p><p>All the hill giants in Grudd Haug, with the exception of Guh, are enslaved males. The ogres serve Guh because they are impressed by her size and her determination to rise to the top of the ordning (and, they hope, bring them along with her). The goblinoids have been promised shares of the spoils. The Iceshield orcs haunt the hills and grasslands north of Grudd Haug, near the western edge of the High Forest, and have forged a tenuous alliance with Guh. They are the least loyal of her supporters and don't get along with the goblinoids.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Grudd Haug Roster\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"715\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Grudd Haug Roster</span></h3> <table class=\"w-100 rd__table stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Area</th><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Creature(s)</th><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-8\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\">1</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2\">1 male @UUID[Actor.3TipXibcB2bNDSir]{hill giant}</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-8\">On Guh's command, the giant moves the boulder into the doorway and stands guard outside.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\">2</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2\">@UUID[Actor.JkP7gg3B5COYQkmu]{Chief Guh}, 5 male @UUID[Actor.3TipXibcB2bNDSir]{hill giants}, 4 @UUID[Actor.E5B1fQJu0zWYKjIR]{ogres}, 6 @UUID[Actor.FTpa9QcNjUcitQRz]{goblins}</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-8\">Guh doesn't move.

Oil lamps in iron sconces are mounted to thick wooden pillars that support rafters 30 feet from the floor and the roof, which peaks 65 feet overhead. Protruding from the north, west, and south walls is a 10-foot-wide, 20-foot-high wooden ledge that the goblins use to get around the room. (The ledge was added after several goblins were crushed underfoot by careless hill giants and ogres.) A wooden ladder climbs up to the ledge, and windows a couple of feet above the ledge let shafts of natural light into the hall.</p><p>Eight sturdy but battered wooden tables covered with globs of grease, gnawed bones, empty casks, and scraps of food stand near the north and south walls, while empty ale barrels lie around and underneath them. Refuse covers the dried mud floor, in the middle of which are two 20-foot-diameter circular holes topped with crisscrossing wooden beams held in place by mud cement. The beams are far enough apart that a Medium or smaller creature can slip between them without having to squeeze. A horrible stench rises from the holes, accompanied by the squealing of pigs (see @UUID[.0000000000000005#12.-pigpen]{area 12}).</p><p>@UUID[Actor.JkP7gg3B5COYQkmu]{Chief Guh} lies at the west end of the hall, slumped atop a four-wheeled, flatbed wagon that bends and creaks under her great bulk. The wagon's axles are cracked and bowed, its wheels canted inward. Piled around the wagon are bones and other refuse from Guh's recent meals, as well as the treasures she has amassed (see \"Treasure\"). Guh weighs more than 20,000 pounds. She can't move, so she keeps her greatclub close by so that she can bop creatures on the noggin. She is a @UUID[Actor.3TipXibcB2bNDSir]{hill giant} with the following changes:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">She has 160 hit points and a speed of 0 feet.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">Her Dexterity is 1 (−5), giving her AC 9.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">She speaks Common, Giant, and Goblin, though her vocabulary is limited to monosyllabic words.</li></ul><p>An unarmed @UUID[Actor.FTpa9QcNjUcitQRz]{goblin}, Snert, is stuck in the folds of Guh's flesh.

When Guh drops to 0 hit points, Snerk is no longer &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] and tumbles into an unoccupied space next to her, gasping for air. He isn't one of the six goblins guarding the room.</p><p>If the characters get this far without raising the alarm and present themselves to Guh, she initially doesn't know what to make of them. Are they servants sent by one of her allies? Are they food? Unless the characters convince Guh that they are more valuable alive than dead, she assumes the latter and orders her mates and minions to beat them to death so that she can feast on their flesh and gnaw on their bones.</p><p>If the characters tell Guh a story that explains why they need her @UUID[Item.zDgKqy8YpOBW8a8o]{conch of teleportation}, she wiggles uncomfortably but refuses to give up the item, instead ordering her servants to attack.

The ogres stand ready to serve meals to Guh as they are brought before her. While the ogres and the giants engage in melee combat, the goblins spread out atop the wooden ledge and pepper intruders with arrows. Meanwhile, the wolves in @UUID[.0000000000000005#3.-wolf-pen]{area 3} begin barking and howling, which puts the rest of the den on alert. If the characters flee, Guh orders her hill giant mates to stay and protect her while any surviving ogres chase after the fleeing characters.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Guh's Wagon-Throne\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"722\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Guh's Wagon-Throne</span></h3> <p>Any character who studies Guh's \"throne\" can, with a successful [[/save ability=int dc=10]] check, figure out how to sever a wagon axle with a single hit, causing the wagon bed to fall and spilling Guh onto the floor. Hitting the axle just right requires a successful melee or ranged attack against AC 15 that deals 7 or more damage. Not only does this send Guh tumbling to the floor, but on her next turn she tries to stand up and instead rolls into the nearest pit, breaking through the wooden crossbeams.

She is using the dissolution of the ordning as an excuse to destroy what she has come to fear and abhor—the rapidly spreading civilizations of humans and their ilk. Kayalithica's followers, who are predominantly neutral, believe that violence against small folk is justified, because their thane has assured them that she is heeding the will of Skoraeus Stonebones.</p><p>Kayalithica believes that the works of the small folk are a pox on the land. They desecrate the very stone upon which they are built. By obliterating them, she hopes to impress the gods and elevate her people to the top of the ordning. By the time the adventurers set a course for her canyon, Kayalithica has already led major assaults against the nearby settlements of Orlbar and Llorkh. The stone giant thane now has her sights set on Loudwater or Parnast, and she has asked Skoraeus Stonebones to send her divine guidance about which community to attack next.</p><p>Not all members of Kayalithica's clan support the thane. A few have fled into the nearby mountains and foothills, fearing that Deadstone Cleft has become a cursed place. These stone giants won't easily be turned against their thane, but they might be persuaded to help adventurers survive the perils of Deadstone Cleft by providing information about the canyon and its defenses.

When the petrification ends, the giant awakens with @sense[tremorsense|MM] (see the <i>Monster Manual</i>) and the ability to cast a handful of spells for a limited time. Stone giants refer to the petrified state as Olach Morrah, which translates as \"the Great Stillness.\" The giants of Deadstone Cleft gain the following feature.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"></span></span><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Olach Morrah\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"752\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Olach Morrah.</span></span> The giant meditates for 1 hour, during which time it can do nothing else. At the end of the hour, provided the giant's meditation has been uninterrupted, it becomes petrified for 8 hours. At the end of this time, the giant is no longer petrified and gains tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet, as well as a measure of innate spellcasting ability based on Wisdom.

The corpses create a sense of unease and dread, warning visitors that Deadstone Cleft is a place of death. As cold wind passes through the canyon, it produces a moan that seems to issue from the gaping mouths of the bodies, adding to the eerie atmosphere. Dotting the canyon walls are several openings that lead to stone-carved tombs and other chambers, some open to the sky and others beneath hundreds of feet of stone. Carved stone bridges also span the canyon.</p><p>Deadstone Cleft is sacred to the stone giants of the Graypeak Mountains, for it contains an ancient temple dedicated to their god, Skoraeus Stonebones, and a magical stalactite, the Steinfang, into which the giants carve questions. The carvings fade on nights of the new moon and are replaced with answers. The giants believe that these replies come from Skoraeus Stonebones himself, though in truth they are produced by an ancient, evil earth primordial trapped under the Graypeak Mountains since the dawn of time. Human and dwarven miners have long avoided the canyon for fear of antagonizing the stone giants known to dwell at Deadstone Cleft. The stone giants don't tolerate uninvited guests in their hallowed halls, attacking them on sight.</p><p>Adventurers can find the canyon by traveling upstream along an arm of the Loagrann River. This great flow once carved the canyon out of the rock that now surrounds it. Time has reduced it to a stream that tumbles along the canyon floor before widening and continuing its long journey southwest, where it merges with the Delimbiyr River on its way to the sea.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Deadstone Cleft: General Features\"><h4 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"754\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Deadstone Cleft: General Features</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span title=\"Page 148\">p148</span></span></span></h4> <p>A stream runs through the canyon, with stone embankments on both sides.

Ostorian stone giants were slightly taller than their descendants; the fossilized stone giants stand between 20 and 24 feet tall. Erosion has worn smooth their features. The dead stone giants are harmless, albeit eerie to behold.

They can also take a boat up the Loagrann River. Use the Random Wilderness Encounters table in chapter 3 to generate encounters, as desired. The characters can also reach Deadstone Cleft by air, using the methods discussed in the sections that follow.

Neither settlement is close to Deadstone Cleft, requiring the characters and their mounts to rest between flights. Characters mounted on hippogriffs can travel 54 miles per day (three 3-hour flights with 1-hour rests in between). Griffon riders can travel 72 miles in the same amount of time. Any NPCs who accompany the characters on this excursion remain with the mounts, protecting them while the characters explore Deadstone Cleft.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Approaching the Canyon\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"763\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Approaching the Canyon</span></h2> <p>Billowing clouds of mist lightly obscure Deadstone Cleft, the location of which is ultimately betrayed by the moaning wind that passes through it—a haunting dirge that can be heard up to a quarter mile away. Guarding the mouth of the canyon is a roc that the stone giants have tamed (see @UUID[.0000000000000006#2.-rocs-nest]{area 2}). Characters who see the mouth of the canyon can also see the roc's nest nearby.</p><p>The canyon is easily spotted from the air, as are three nearby caves that are open to the sky (areas 5, 7, and 12). Characters who have an airship or flying mounts can land above or inside the canyon, or in one of these open caves. If the characters approach Deadstone Cleft in an airship and move into the roc's line of sight, the roc takes to the sky and attacks it. The airship can't outrun or outmaneuver the roc, which is too big to land on the deck or reach creatures on the deck with its claws. The roc can bite creatures on deck, but it prefers to attack the balloon itself (see the \"Airship of a Cult\" section in chapter 4 for the balloon's statistics). If it successfully brings down the airship, the roc spends a few rounds picking through the wreckage in search of food before returning to its nest. If the characters approach on flying mounts, the roc attacks them only if they approach within 120 feet of its nest and it can see them.</p><p>Characters above the canyon have the option of climbing down into the jagged rift at a point of their choosing. The sounds of their descent are muffled by the wind.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Denizens\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"764\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Denizens</span></h2> <p>Ten stone giants reside in Deadstone Cleft when the adventurers arrive, including @UUID[Actor.GcQcxqRbegPcFL9S]{Thane Kayalithica}. With the exception of the giant in @UUID[.0000000000000006#6.-roc-handler]{area 6}, who checks on the roc, the giants remain in their caves and wait for enemies to come to them. Once they enter combat, the giants pursue enemies that attempt to flee.</p><p>The Blue Bear tribe of Uthgardt barbarians shares Kayalithica's belief that civilization is a blight on the land. The barbarians stalk the foothills of the Graypeaks and hunt wild game in Delimbiyr Vale. They also occupy several caves within Deadstone Cleft and look after the stone giants' cave bear pets. @UUID[Actor.38Cnf3s5E31VzUDm]{Hydia Moonmusk}, the fearless daughter of the Blue Bear tribe's great chief, has made a den for herself in the bear cave near the mouth of the canyon (@UUID[.0000000000000006#3.-bear-cave]{area 3}).</p><p>Characters who allow Hydia enough time to gather her tribemates might face all of the Uthgardt barbarians in Deadstone Cleft at once.

Pools of rainwater have formed on the floor to each side of a giant slab of pale gray stone. Three dead, fossilized stone giants in alcoves loom above the Skodkong, posing no threat to intruders.</p><p>The stone slab is actually the Skodkong's reshaped body, which has giant hand-shaped indentations all over it. Any creature that presses its hands to the stone leaves shallow indentations in its surface, as though the slab was made of soft clay. Nothing else can reshape or penetrate the stone.</p><p>The first character who attempts to reach into the slab is irresistibly pulled into it, after which the stone instantly hardens. While trapped in the stone, the character is restrained, can't hear or see anything, and has &amp;Reference[rule=totalcover]{total cover}. The character hears a deep, rumbling voice say, \"Ask!\" in Common. The character can now ask the Skodkong three questions, and it provides truthful, all-knowing answers that only the character can hear. (You can take the character's player aside if you wish, because the other characters can't overhear what's being said.) Once it has answered three questions, the Skodkong releases the character, who is pushed out of the slab. The Skodkong can't be contacted more than once during this adventure. If the character drawn into the slab asks no questions, the Skodkong expels the character after 1 minute. Once that character is expelled, another character can attempt to contact the Skodkong as described above.

If the roper is offered a gemstone worth 50 gp or more, it swallows the gem and lets intruders pass unmolested.

The monument is an astonishing bit of stonecraft in terms of its sheer size. Rivulets of water pour down from the mountain onto the statue, which channels the water into a stream that flows out through the canyon. The sound of falling water is quite loud here, and a thick mist drifts over everything. Characters who inspect the statue and succeed on a [[/save ability=wis dc=20]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Perception]) check spot a crystal ball-sized orb embedded in its right eye (see \"Treasure\").</p><p>Two @UUID[Actor.qLvIubOyIxPNAaCp]{stone giants} kneel before the statue, their heads bowed, their stone greatclubs lying on the ground beside them. They haven't performed the meditation ritual and thus don't gain the benefits of the Olach Morrah feature (see \"The Great Stillness\" section earlier in this chapter). Characters who attack surprise them. These giants are neutral, however, not evil. They have begun to question Kayalithica's sanity and are praying to Skoraeus Stonebones for wisdom. If the characters attack them, the giants become enraged and retaliate in kind. If the characters get their attention in a nonthreatening manner, the giants rise to their feet and look at them quizzically, but don't immediately reach for their greatclubs. The giants speak and understand Giant only. If the characters ask them about Kayalithica or her @UUID[Item.zDgKqy8YpOBW8a8o]{conch of teleportation} in that language, the giants share the following information:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">Kayalithica is in the temple.

All other stone giants must remain outside or face certain punishment, by order of @UUID[Actor.GcQcxqRbegPcFL9S]{Thane Kayalithica} and the others who have come before her. The Uthgardt are likewise forbidden to enter, as are the characters.</p><p>The fossilized remains of three long-dead thanes stand in alcoves carved into the west wall, their eyes fixed on a rocky island surrounded by gorgon mud (see @UUID[.0000000000000006#4.-gorgon-mud-pool]{area 4}). The mud, which Kayalithica refers to as the Fjellblod (\"blood of the mountain\"), oozes into the cave through stone grates in the northeast and southeast walls. The mud is 20 feet deep. Two sturdy stone bridges span the mud pool, connecting the island to nearby ledges. Overlooking these bridges are two more fossilized stone giant thanes.</p><p>The room's most prominent feature is the Steinfang, a 40-foot-long stalactite that hangs from the ceiling above the island. From a base 20 feet in diameter, it tapers to a rough point a few feet above the surface of the island. The Steinfang is etched with questions written by Kayalithica in Dethek, the Dwarvish script. The stone giant thane is carving new questions into the stalactite when the characters arrive. By entering the cave, the characters have committed a blasphemy that Kayalithica can't forgive. She is a @UUID[Actor.qLvIubOyIxPNAaCp]{stone giant}, with the following changes:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">Kayalithica is neutral evil and has 170 hit points.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">She has a Charisma of 14 (+2).</li><li class=\"rd__li\">She has gained the benefits of the Olach Morrah feature (see \"The Great Stillness\" section earlier in this chapter).</li><li class=\"rd__li\">She wields an <i>adamantine greatclub</i>. This magic weapon has no bonus to attack or damage rolls. A creature can attune to it, and the weapon enlarges or reduces to be an appropriate size for that creature.</li></ul><p>Once during this adventure, as an action, Kayalithica can point to one of the fossilized stone giants in this cave and cause it to animate as a Huge @UUID[Actor.H10a56U5oRpsHtZk]{stone golem} with 195 ([[/r 17d12 + 85]]) hit points. Its statistics are otherwise those of a stone golem. She animates the giant that stands closest to the character or characters she considers the most threatening, then orders the construct to attack them. The golem obeys Kayalithica's commands; it crumbles and is destroyed instantly if she dies.</p><p>If the characters make ranged attacks against her, Kayalithica casts @spell[meld into stone] and hides within the stalactite. She waits until they are close before emerging to attack them with her <i>adamantine greatclub</i>. The Steinfang is impervious to all spells of 3rd level or lower, but has vulnerability to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from adamantine weapons. It has AC 15, a damage threshold of 10, and 100 hit points. When the Steinfang drops to 0 hit points, it explodes, and each creature on or above the island must make a [[/save ability=dex dc=15]] saving throw, taking 70 ([[/r 20d6]]) bludgeoning damage from flying debris on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature melded with the Steinfang when it explodes takes no damage and appears out of the midst of the explosion.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Kayalithica's Questions\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"793\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Kayalithica's Questions</span></h3> <p>Like her ancestors before her, @UUID[Actor.GcQcxqRbegPcFL9S]{Kayalithica} believes that the stalactite allows her to commune with Skoraeus Stonebones, the god of stone giants. In truth, the Steinfang is part of a malevolent earth primordial named Draunn, which lies trapped somewhere deep beneath the Graypeak Mountains. The primordial sleeps most of the time, waking only on nights of the new moon. Other thanes who earlier allowed themselves to be corrupted by the Steinfang were held in check by @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton}, but with him out of the way, Kayalithica is free to cause the harm that her \"god\" demands.</p><p>Any creature can carve questions onto the stalactite. These questions (along with anything else carved into the stone) remain until the next new moon, when the carvings are replaced by answers written in Dethek, the Dwarvish script. Any carving that isn't a question simply vanishes, with nothing appearing in its place. Questions that Kayalithica has carved into the Steinfang include:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"></span></span><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li\"><i>What must I do next to please you, noble father?</i></li><li class=\"rd__li\"><i>Do the dream-creatures pose any danger to us?</i></li><li class=\"rd__li\"><i>Are there any traitors in my clan?</i></li><li class=\"rd__li\"><i>Can these puny barbarians be trusted?</i></li><li class=\"rd__li\"><i>Is the gnome lying about Loudwater's defenses?</i></li></ul></div></div><p>The primordial isn't an all-knowing entity—quite the contrary. Its answers are motivated by a desire to sow discord, and it has no knowledge of anything happening in the world. If the characters wait around to see what answers appear, roll a [[/r d20]] and assume that the next new moon occurs in that many nights. Its answers to the above questions are as follows: \"Destroy the works of the surface dwellers,\" \"Yes,\" \"Yes,\" \"No,\" and \"Yes.\"</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Treasure\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"794\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></h3> <p>Thane @UUID[Actor.GcQcxqRbegPcFL9S]{Kayalithica} has three pouches (the equivalent of normal-sized sacks) tied to a mithral belt (worth 750 gp) around her waist.

When Kayalithica questioned the gnome, he tried to discourage her from attacking the town by inflating his description of its defensive capabilities. Kayalithica is waiting for the Steinfang to confirm whether the gnome spoke truthfully. In the meantime, she keeps @UUID[Actor.RdCEL0drYmPFQJFW]{Elister} tucked away. He has survived by using his magic to create food and water. He claims there was no point in trying to escape Deadstone Cleft on his own, since the stone giants would probably kill him for trying. @UUID[Actor.RdCEL0drYmPFQJFW]{Elister} has the statistics of a @UUID[Actor.BSvzE801ExHkxapo]{priest}, with the following changes:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">He is Small and chaotic neutral.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">He has a speed of 25 feet.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">He has advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">He has the @spell[create food and water] spell prepared instead of @spell[spirit guardians].</li><li class=\"rd__li\">He speaks Common and Gnomish.</li></ul><p>A devout worshiper of Gond, god of inventors, @UUID[Actor.RdCEL0drYmPFQJFW]{Elister} gives the party a small clock (worth 1,500 gp) from his shop as a reward for saving his life and getting him home safely. The clock contains a tiny bell that rings at the top of each hour and can be heard out to a range of 60 feet. After ringing at highsun, the clock must be wound or it stops working. Winding the clock requires a tiny key (which @UUID[Actor.RdCEL0drYmPFQJFW]{Elister} provides) and takes an action. The clock keeps excellent time.</p><p>Characters who visit @UUID[Actor.RdCEL0drYmPFQJFW]{Elister}'s shop in Loudwater discover that he has a gnome-sized clockwork companion. The construct, Tick Tock, has the statistics of @UUID[Actor.Uljk8Z1Z0Pil0NbL]{animated armor} except that its size is Small and it has 27 ([[/r 6d6 + 6]]) hit points. It follows @UUID[Actor.RdCEL0drYmPFQJFW]{Elister}'s commands only.</p><p>If the characters have an airship, @UUID[Actor.RdCEL0drYmPFQJFW]{Elister} takes a shine to it and asks to remain aboard, offering to oversee repairs and serve as an emergency medic.

The runes told Storvald that help would come to him after he staged a series of raids on coastal communities. He sent ships to attack sites along the Sword Coast, and during a raid on Port Llast, the giants captured a Zhentarim mage, Nilraun Dhaerlost. Nilraun was dragged before Storvald and came to realize that the frost giants were searching for the @UUID[Item.TSP7L6B2lr8l5ONB]{Ring of Winter}. As the runes had foretold, Nilraun was also searching for the ring and knew about its recent history. He suggested the formation of an alliance between @UUID[Actor.WCaTcC0r6QQDgeSR]{Jarl Storvald} and the Black Network, sweetening the deal by offering the frost giant jarl exactly what he needed: information on the ring's current wearer, Artus Cimber, and a drop of Cimber's blood (which the Black Network had in its possession). Nilraun is now waiting for the frost giants to track down the ring, so that he can steal it and claim it for himself. Storvald also wants the ring, and each villain is secretly plotting to betray the other once the ring is found.</p><p>Storvald used Artus Cimber's drop of blood in a rune magic ritual to turn a giant diamond into a <i>blod stone</i> (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000014]{appendix B}). Unfortunately for the jarl, the item can't find Artus Cimber specifically; instead, it identifies the location of the nearest creature that has Artus's blood flowing through its veins. Artus has many living relatives, and a few of those reside in the North. The @UUID[Item.STjByzekFu3NhKKO]{blod stone} has pointed Storvald toward the town of Bryn Shander in Icewind Dale, where one of Artus's children dwells (see chapter 2). The jarl has sent a band of frost giants there to find Artus Cimber and obtain the ring.</p><p>The @UUID[Item.TSP7L6B2lr8l5ONB]{Ring of Winter} is an elusive artifact, and neither it nor its bearer can be found in the course of this adventure. Characters who set out to find the ring for themselves will quickly hit one dead end after another. Even divination won't reveal the ring's current whereabouts. Over the years, various Harpers have dedicated resources toward finding Artus Cimber and the ring, to no avail. If the Harpers catch wind of the characters' attempts to locate Artus and the ring, they try to discourage any such pursuit. Artus Cimber and the @UUID[Item.TSP7L6B2lr8l5ONB]{Ring of Winter} have roles to play in another adventure.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Svardborg\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"816\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Svardborg</span></h1> <p>In the age when giants ruled the North, Svardborg was a remote village where frost giants came to hunt whales and giant walruses. It was abandoned after the empire of Ostoria fell and, over time, drifted northward and became entombed in ice. Today, Svardborg floats amid hundreds of other icebergs in the Sea of Moving Ice. Three of the lodges are still entombed in ice, while the others have been chipped out of the ice and rendered habitable. The expansion and contraction of the ice over the centuries damaged the lodges, and repairs to them are under way. @UUID[Actor.WCaTcC0r6QQDgeSR]{Jarl Storvald} has sent ships to the mainland to gather the wood needed to make repairs.</p><p>The lodges are perched on sheer cliffs of ice that plunge 50 feet into the sea. The cliffs are only 10 feet high near the Drydock Lodge (@UUID[.0000000000000007#3.-drydock-lodge]{area 3}), where the giants have built a wooden pier for docking their punts.</p><p>A wide cleft in the iceberg offers access to Svardborg's hollow heart—a water-filled chamber open to the sky where the giants moor their greatships. Stretched across the passage is a gate in the form of a net of thick iron chains. The giants lower the chains into the water to let their ships pass through. A small vessel, such as a rowboat sized for humans, can slip through the net even while the gate is raised. Ships bigger than a rowboat are too large to pass through the gate when it is raised.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Reaching Svardborg\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"817\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Reaching Svardborg</span></h2> <p>Unless they have the means to get there by air, the characters must secure passage on a ship and travel across the Sea of Moving Ice to reach Svardborg (shown on maps 7.1 and 7.2).</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Airship\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"818\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Airship</span></h3> <p>If the characters have an airship (see the \"Airship of a Cult\" section in chapter 4), they can use it to reach Svardborg and avoid a long, icy sea voyage.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Flying Mounts\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"819\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Flying Mounts</span></h3> <p>The coastal village of Fireshear is home to a griffon rider and trainer, Dasharra Keldabar. Characters seeking flying mounts in Waterdeep, Neverwinter, or Luskan are directed to Dasharra. They can pay her for griffon-riding lessons and then use the griffons to fly to Svardborg. When the characters are ready to leave, Dasharra leads the way on Screecher, her personal griffon mount. Dasharra's griffons fly at a speed of 8 miles per hour and can travel roughly 64 miles per day when flying against the wind. The flight to Svardborg takes five days, with strong, cold headwinds the entire way. Thanks to a stiff tailwind, the return trip is shorter, with the griffons able to cover roughly 80 miles a day. Dasharra expects characters to provide their own cold weather survival gear, supplies, and rations.</p><p>When the group reaches Svardborg, Dasharra recommends that the characters land their griffons on the docks south of @UUID[.0000000000000007#3.-drydock-lodge]{area 3} (see the \"Approaching Svardborg\" section for other possible places to land). Dasharra remains with the griffons while the characters explore the frost giant fortress, and the characters can count on her to stick around for the return trip.</p><p>Characters can secure flying mounts of a different sort at Hawk's Nest, where knights of the Order of the Gauntlet breed hippogriffs. The journey from Hawk's Nest to Svardborg is long. Flying west against headwinds, the hippogriffs can travel 45 miles per day (three 3-hour flights with 1-hour rests in between). An eastward journey benefits from tailwinds, allowing the hippogriffs to travel 60 miles per day.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Seafaring Vessel\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"820\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Seafaring Vessel</span></h3> <p>Characters who need to make the trip by ship can find a seafaring vessel in Luskan, Neverwinter, or Waterdeep.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Luskan\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"821\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Luskan.</span></span> The characters can approach one of the city's High Captains.

Once Svardborg is sighted, the ship drops anchor behind a nearby iceberg. The characters can lower rowboats into the sea and use them to reach Svardborg in 30 minutes. Captain Redreef agrees to wait up to 24 hours before raising anchor and setting sail for Luskan. If Svardborg's warning horn (@UUID[.0000000000000007#2c.-warning-horn]{area 2C}) is sounded, the inexperienced captain panics and abandons the party, ordering the crew to return home.</p><p>Characters who want to buy a ship can pay 10,000 gp for a leaky old longship that belongs to one of the High Captains. The characters must hire a crew of at least forty. A common sailor (use the @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner} statistics) costs 2 sp per day, while a skilled sailor (use the @UUID[Actor.mi7jBroOT38LUqCV]{bandit} statistics) demands 2 gp per day. The characters can also try to hire a captain (use the @UUID[Actor.uXGxDbtKu6GmgNFF]{bandit captain} statistics) who normally charges 10 gp per day.

Neverember knows that the Sea of Moving Ice is patrolled by white dragons and seafaring barbarians, so a character must make a successful [[/save ability=cha dc=17]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Persuasion]) check to convince him of the mission's importance. If he decides to help, Neverember arranges for a galley called the <i>Seabreaker</i> to transport the characters.</p><p>The <i>Seabreaker</i>'s captain is an uptight albino wizard, Draevyn Thornbolt (N male Illuskan human @UUID[Actor.sMYXCW2K2ptMY1Wb]{mage}).

During the meeting, Laeral explains that ships are hard to come by in Waterdeep these days; the City of Splendors is in the midst of building a new navy after its fleet was scuttled by Dagult Neverember. Saying it's the best she can do, Laeral offers to give the characters a damaged longship that was recently captured by privateers. What the adventurers choose to do with it is up to them. The ship has 150 hit points and is worth 5,000 gp in its present condition. (For rules on ship repair, see the \"<a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,5,the%20sea,0\">Owning a Ship</a>\" section in chapter 5 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>.) The longship's bow is carved and painted to look like the head and neck of a red dragon. The crew costs in Waterdeep are the same as those in Luskan.</p><p>If the characters are unable to meet with Laeral Silverhand, they can find a Tethyrian captain willing to take them north into the Sea of Moving Ice for 5,000 gp. The captain, Lady Taska Sonadora (CG female Tethyrian human @UUID[Actor.XgAjpoJSv5Bqo6gO]{noble}), is, by all accounts, insane. She likes to spend her inherited wealth on bold (some would say foolish) ventures, and dreams of killing a white dragon and draping its hide over the wooden throne she keeps in her spacious cabin. She can be talked down to 2,500 gp if the characters promise to help her slay a dragon and let her keep its hide as a trophy.</p><p>Captain Sonadora's sailing ship is called the <i>Bobbin' Flagon</i>, and she stocks its hold with the finest Waterdhavian food and brandy for her crew of twenty sailors (CG male and female Tethyrian human @UUID[Actor.mi7jBroOT38LUqCV]{bandits}). Her manservant is the overworked, underpaid, mean Finn (CN male lightfoot halfling @UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoner}).</p><p>The <i>Bobbin' Flagon</i> has four rowboats. Sonadora won't risk her ship in an assault of Svardborg, but she can easily be persuaded to accompany the adventurers as they explore the frost giant fortress if she thinks there's a white dragon to be had. In that case, she orders Finn and six armed sailors to join her. Two rowboats are needed to transport Captain Sonadora and her away team, leaving two rowboats for the adventurers.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Approaching Svardborg\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"824\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Approaching Svardborg</span></h2> <p>Svardborg is so isolated that the frost giants don't bother posting lookouts.

The fire giant duke has also struck an alliance with the drow of House Xorlarrin: he promises to help them destroy their enemies if the drow help him steal Maegera, the fire primordial trapped within the underground dwarven city of Gauntlgrym. House Xorlarrin once held Gauntlgrym, but King Bruenor Battlehammer and his dwarves recently drove out the dark elves. They know its layout well, however. @UUID[Actor.dEAfcnl04rCFkRQm]{Duke Zalto} has given the drow an @UUID[Item.UcKu1vYTkUNWGIyC]{iron flask} (see chapter 7 of the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,7\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>) in which to trap Maegera. While the drow creep back into Gauntlgrym to perpetrate this great theft (see the \"Gauntlgrym\" section in chapter 3), Zalto readies his family's ancestral forge for the arrival of Maegera and the Vonindod fragments.</p><p>In this part of their mission, the characters journey to Ironslag, Zalto's fortress in the icy mountains north of the Silver Marches. @UUID[Actor.dEAfcnl04rCFkRQm]{Duke Zalto} and his fire giants unlocked and reclaimed the forge several months ago. Since then, the fire giants have captured slaves and put them to work in the forges. The dwarves of Citadel Adbar and Citadel Felbarr are aware that fire giants have returned to Ironslag; however, the dwarves are still recovering from the War of the Silver Marches and aren't prepared to mount an attack on the giant fortress.</p><p>Characters who visit Ironslag must contend not only with the fire giant duke, his family, and his most loyal followers but also with a village of sinister yakfolk. If the characters obtain Zalto's @UUID[Item.zDgKqy8YpOBW8a8o]{conch of teleportation}, they can use it to travel to Maelstrom, Hekaton's undersea citadel (see chapter 10, \"Hold of the Storm Giants\") and advance to the next stage of the adventure.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Fire Giants\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"887\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Fire Giants</span></h1> <p>Before running this part of the adventure, review the information on fire giants in the Monster Manual.

For years, more powerful giants have curtailed Zalto's violent predilections, but with @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} out of the picture and the storm giant court in disarray, Zalto has set into motion a plot to wage war on dragonkind for the glory of Surtur and the divine favor of Annam the All-Father. It begins with the reconstruction of the Vonindod, a dragon-slaying colossus built by his ancient ancestors.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.dEAfcnl04rCFkRQm]{Duke Zalto} has a nagging wife, @UUID[Actor.newBXvdCGHqG2aXC]{Brimskarda}, and two ill-tempered children—a belligerent daughter named @UUID[Actor.ktABM2x5HvAOdErf]{Cinderhild} and a sadistic son named @UUID[Actor.gyd1a3FkymcJ8NVT]{Zaltember}. The children distract him from his enterprise while his wife chastises him for not acting quickly enough. Brimskarda fears that one of the other giant lords will win the gods' favor first. Zalto is feeling the pressure, given that his success hinges on his ability to reignite Ironslag's adamantine forge and his minions' ability to retrieve all the missing fragments of the Vonindod. Unfortunately for Zalto, those are the least of his problems. The arrogant fire giant duke has failed to account for the interference of puny adventurers and a certain ancient red dragon (see the \"Klauthen Vale\" section in chapter 3 and the \"Airship of a Cult\" section in chapter 4).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"The Xorlarrin Alliance\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"889\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Xorlarrin Alliance</span></h2> <p>@UUID[Actor.dEAfcnl04rCFkRQm]{Duke Zalto's} alliance with House Xorlarrin is built on his firm promise that, once he climbs to the top of the ordning, he will use his forge and his newfound might to help House Xorlarrin destroy its enemies, starting with the dwarves who cast the drow out of Gauntlgrym. For their part, the drow are more interested in supporting Zalto's plan to wage war on dragonkind, for such a war would spell certain doom for the human, dwarven, and elven civilizations of the North—something the Xorlarrin drow desire above all else.</p><p>By the time the characters begin their journey to Ironslag, the drow have already managed to infiltrate Gauntlgrym (using their extensive knowledge of the dwarven city's layout). If the drow capture Maegera and deliver the @UUID[Item.UcKu1vYTkUNWGIyC]{iron flask} to Ironslag, the characters might encounter them in the fire giant fortress. Unless the characters defeat @UUID[Actor.dEAfcnl04rCFkRQm]{Duke Zalto} or otherwise prevent the @UUID[Item.UcKu1vYTkUNWGIyC]{iron flask} from falling into his possession, he traps Maegera in the adamantine forge (@UUID[.0000000000000008#29.-adamantine-forge]{area 29}). The fire generated by Maegera is sufficiently hot for Zalto and his fire giants to begin reforging the Vonindod.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Yakfolk Neighbors\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"890\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Yakfolk Neighbors</span></h2> <p>Zalto has come to terms with the yakfolk that live on the mountainside above Ironslag. These malevolent creatures watch over the topmost entrance to the giants' fortress and also tend crops for the giants. In exchange, the giants leave them alone. The two kinds of yakfolk, warriors and priests, are described in @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000015]{appendix C}. Also present in the village are a number of slaves—humanoid prisoners that the yakfolk use for manual labor.</p><p>The yakfolk feign benevolence, offering food and shelter to wayward visitors, only to shed their guise of friendly hosts when their guests are most vulnerable. While their visitors sleep, the yakfolk beat them &amp;Reference[condition=unconscious], strip them of their gear and weapons, and consign them to a life of slavery. Deprived of food and warmth, slaves rarely survive more than a week.</p><p>To untrained eyes, the yakfolk village looks like a peaceful, idyllic hideaway perched atop a mountain cliff, with granite walls to keep the howling wind at bay. The dwarves of Citadel Adbar know better than to trust the yakfolk, and they occasionally send patrols north to spy on the village. One of those patrols was ambushed by yakfolk and the survivors taken prisoner. The yakfolk used their magic to possess the bodies of their dwarven captives and, in the guise of these dwarves, yakfolk spies have infiltrated Citadel Adbar. These agents do everything in their power to discourage the dwarves from attacking Ironslag, mostly by assuring the citadel's leaders that the yakfolk pose no immediate threat. They also stand ready to assassinate Adbar's ruler, King Harnoth, if he tries to mount an attack on the village.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Yakfolk Village Roster (day)\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"891\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Yakfolk Village Roster (day)</span></h3> <table class=\"w-100 rd__table stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Area</th><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Creature(s)</th><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-8\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\">3</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\">2 @UUID[Actor.CEDM7DEgL7mDnSpq]{yakfolk warriors}</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-8\">When an alarm sounds, the yakfolk kill their slaves and then head toward @UUID[.0000000000000008#8.-hall-of-the-yakfolk-chief]{area 8}, attacking intruders they encounter along the way.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\">4A–4C</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\">1 @UUID[Actor.CEDM7DEgL7mDnSpq]{yakfolk warrior}, [[/r 2d4]] @UUID[Actor.XoDFk6X2bg2xi4sG]{boars}, [[/r 2d4]] yaks</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-8\">When an alarm sounds, the yakfolk kills its slaves and then heads toward @UUID[.0000000000000008#8.-hall-of-the-yakfolk-chief]{area 8}, attacking intruders it encounters along the way.

Carved into the base of a 500-foot-high mountainside cliff is a pair of 50-foot-tall adamantine doors—airtight valves sealed by ancient magic. Adventurers hoping to gain access to the forge must figure out a way through these doors or find an alternate route. One such route is a staircase carved into the mountainside (see @UUID[.0000000000000008#1.-twelve-thousand-steps]{area 1}).

Yakfolk are vile in their pragmatism. Before setting out to confront invaders, they murder their slaves to prevent them from being freed or turned against them.

This bucket chain is turned by a slave wheel (@UUID[.0000000000000008#20.-slave-wheel]{area 20}) and moves clockwise through the upper level of the fortress, transporting the iron ore to the dressing mill (@UUID[.0000000000000008#12.-dressing-mill]{area 12}) to be broken up. Iron ore is then loaded into buckets and transported to the foundry, where ogres on the gantries (@UUID[.0000000000000008#18.-foundry,-upper-level]{area 18}) use long, hooked poles to tip the buckets, causing the ore to fall into the smelters below (@UUID[.0000000000000008#34.-foundry,-lower-level]{area 34}). Enormous bellows raise the temperature inside the smelters, melting the iron. The molten iron spills into a huge stone trough (@UUID[.0000000000000008#35.-forges]{area 35}), where it is channeled into molds and used to forge giant-sized swords and armor.</p><p>The iron buckets are spaced 10 feet apart. Each one is 10 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. A bucket can hold one Large creature or up to four Medium creatures. Two Small creatures can take the place of one Medium creature.

The noise is so loud that activity in one area usually doesn't draw the attention of creatures in adjacent areas, making it possible for adventurers to eliminate foes a few at a time.</p><p>If the slave wheel stops turning, the bucket chain stops; this is a sign to the fire giants that something is amiss.

A fireplace's flame can be extinguished by plugging the holes, each of which is 4 inches in diameter. Any creature that enters a fire or starts its turn there takes 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) fire damage and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

As the current turns the wheel, it not only powers the elevator in @UUID[.0000000000000008#9.-elevator-shaft]{area 9} but also turns a large millstone located inside a hut next to the wheel, which has a beaded curtain entrance on the south wall. Grain harvested from @UUID[.0000000000000008#7.-crop-fields]{area 7} is brought here and made into flour. The grinding of the millstone, the cranking of the water wheel, and the rush of water pouring down the mountainside drown out most other noises in this area.</p><p>During the day, two @UUID[Actor.CEDM7DEgL7mDnSpq]{yakfolk warriors} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000015]{appendix C}) are here, quietly overseeing a pair of shield dwarf slaves (@UUID[Actor.S13ENmScSu8khIPl]{commoners}) who shovel flour into burlap sacks, which are then taken to the bread ovens in @UUID[.0000000000000008#5.-hut]{area 5}. The yakfolk sit on stools and either smoke pipes or sew blankets to pass the time as they watch the dwarves work. At night, the mill is unoccupied; the yakfolk retire to their hut (@UUID[.0000000000000008#5a.-millkeepers-hut]{area 5A}) while the dwarves sleep in a cage behind it.

This is a dangerous act, and getting from one side to the other requires a successful [[/save ability=str dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) or Dexterity (&amp;Reference[skill=Acrobatics]) check. A character who fails the check doesn't make it across and must make a [[/save ability=dex dc=10]] saving throw. On a failed save, the character is swept down the river and tumbles down the mountainside, taking 70 ([[/r 20d6]]) bludgeoning damage from the fall. On a successful save, the character manages to hang onto the wheel or the axle and avoid a fall, but is stuck between the spokes of the wheel and must repeat the check on his or her next turn to reach one end of the axle or the other.</p><p>Characters might try to make this route safer by preventing the water wheel from turning. Jamming a fence post or similar object between the spokes of the water wheel disables it, as does a successful [[/save ability=str dc=20]] check made to grab the wheel and stop it from turning. When the wheel is stopped, the force of the current puts tremendous strain on it. At the end of each turn, the wheel has a 25 percent chance of breaking apart and tumbling down the waterfall. If that happens, the millstone and the elevator (@UUID[.0000000000000008#9.-elevator-shaft]{area 9}) cease to function. Any creature on the wheel when it breaks is swept over the cliff with the wreckage and takes 70 ([[/r 20d6]]) bludgeoning damage from the fall. The breaking of the wheel puts the yakfolk village on alert. Meanwhile, Zalto orders one of the fire giants in @UUID[.0000000000000008#34.-foundry,-lower-level]{area 34} to go to @UUID[.0000000000000008#9.-elevator-shaft]{area 9}, find out what has caused the elevator to stop working, and report back. Unless it encounters trouble along the way, the giant arrives in @UUID[.0000000000000008#9.-elevator-shaft]{area 9} roughly 20 minutes after the elevator stops working. If the giant finds evidence of foul play, it reports back to Zalto (taking 20 minutes to reach him). Zalto then places the foundry on alert, meaning that its defenders can't be @status[surprised].</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"4.

An iron rig is bolted to the pit's circular rim. Suspended from this rig by iron chains is a 60-foot-diameter, circular platform made from oak beams held together by iron bands and rivets. The platform ascends and descends the shaft constantly, powered by a wooden water wheel located behind an opening in the southeast wall. Characters who stand on a gantry bolted to the southern lip of the shaft and look down can see the platform as it rises up.</p><p>The elevator platform makes a programmed series of fifteen stops on its way up and down the shaft, each delay lasting 30 seconds. One of the stops is here, at the top of the shaft. As the platform descends, it stops at twelve mine levels (see the \"Mines\" section in @UUID[.0000000000000008#10.-stairs-to-the-mines]{area 10}) and also pauses at the upper level of Ironslag (@UUID[.0000000000000008#11.-elevator,-upper-level]{area 11}) and the lower level (@UUID[.0000000000000008#24.-elevator,-lower-level]{area 24}). Accounting for all of its stops, it takes the elevator platform 15 minutes to move from the top of the shaft to the bottom, or vice versa. Between stops, it moves at a constant speed.</p><p>Bolted to the northeast wall of the room is a rectangular metal plate with a 3-foot-long iron lever protruding from it. The lever is mounted 10 feet above the floor and is in the up position. Pulling it down triggers a mechanism in the elevator's suspension rig that disengages the elevator from the water wheel axle, which immediately causes the elevator platform to stop. Moving the lever back up reconnects the elevator to the axle, causing the platform to move again. A creature that can reach the lever can use its action to make a [[/save ability=str dc=17]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check, raising or lowering the lever on a success.</p><p>The chains supporting the platform are rusty but large and secure.

Trapping an ice primordial inside it for 1 hour, however, causes the forge to crack, whereupon it ceases to function.</p><p>Flanking the forge are two cable towers that support the bucket chain 50 feet overhead.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Development\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"987\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Development</span></h3> <p>@UUID[Actor.dEAfcnl04rCFkRQm]{Duke Zalto} needs the incredible heat produced by the adamantine forge to repair his colossus, since normal fires aren't hot enough. If Zalto gets his hands on the @UUID[Item.UcKu1vYTkUNWGIyC]{iron flask} containing @UUID[Actor.RCGKvY7XonAcLXvP]{Maegera the Dawn Titan} (see the \"Special Delivery\" section at the end of this chapter), he goes inside the adamantine forge and opens the @UUID[Item.UcKu1vYTkUNWGIyC]{iron flask}, releasing the fire primordial from the flask and trapping it in the forge. Zalto then exits the forge, which begins to put out tremendous heat. The temperature in the room rises immediately, such that any creature that ends its turn in the room takes 5 ([[/r 1d10]]) fire damage, or 11 ([[/r 2d10]]) fire damage if it's wearing metal armor. A creature that comes into direct contact with the superheated shell of the forge for the first time on a turn takes 33 ([[/r 6d10]]) fire damage. A creature that enters the superheated forge for the first time on a turn or starts its turn inside the forge takes 132 ([[/r 24d10]]) fire damage.</p><p>The ancient rune magic that protects the forge also prevents Maegera from escaping, even while the hatch and the vents are open. Maegera can still be trapped inside an @UUID[Item.UcKu1vYTkUNWGIyC]{iron flask} or a similar magical prison, however, and it voluntarily fails any saving throw if doing so enables it to escape from the adamantine forge.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"30.

Now, with the ordning dissolved, a few cloud giant nobles have seized the opportunity to rise above the storm giants and thereby fulfill their lifelong dream of becoming the true, undisputed aristocrats among giants.</p><p>One such noble is @UUID[Actor.WDyUyhSwWBwZaTiF]{Countess Sansuri}, who believes that her destiny lies buried in the past, waiting for her to unearth it. Sansuri's ancient ancestors, anticipating the fall of their great empire, reportedly hid their magical knowledge and wealth in vaults and left markers for future generations to find them. The greatest of these troves was a cache of \"dragon magic\"—spells and artifacts plundered from the lairs of powerful wyrms. Sansuri wants to find this cache and use her newfound power to destroy her ambitious rivals and convince the rest of giantkind to kneel before her. Sansuri believes the gods will reward her appropriately for doing so. When that day comes, all other cloud giants will thank her for doing what they could only dream of.</p><p>After using telescopes to scour the land below for clues, Sansuri has come to the realization that her maps are woefully out of date. She hasn't found a single marker pointing the way to the trove she seeks. When a curious and danger-prone bronze dragon named @UUID[Actor.70ymlDsplvkkfQM4]{Felgolos} paid her a visit some weeks ago, Sansuri played the role of benevolent host. She tricked the dragon into helping her and, when its guard was down, captured and imprisoned it. When the adventurers come knocking, Sansuri is in the midst of torturing the bronze dragon for information, hoping it knows where one of the ancient Ostorian markers might be. The dragon's roars of pain can be heard for miles.</p><p>In this part of their mission, the characters travel to Lyn Armaal, Sansuri's cloud castle, and meet the countess and her family. The countess shares the place with her castellan and consort, @UUID[Actor.N3fkxnXaXlHcQb1v]{Cressaro}; her younger brother, @UUID[Actor.O2h08hOFIKBQUNMT]{Count Thullen}; and her twin children, @UUID[Actor.hzyeMRLIsfdu80ET]{Alastrah} and @UUID[Actor.08WftOoMX1AUzbwq]{Kaaltar}. The castle can be anywhere you want it to be. If you have no particular location in mind, assume that it's hovering one mile above the Evermoors (its default location).</p><p>The characters' primary goal is to find the @UUID[Item.zDgKqy8YpOBW8a8o]{conch of teleportation} that @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} gave to Sansuri, so that they can use it to travel to Maelstrom, Hekaton's undersea citadel (see chapter 10, \"@UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000011]{Hold of the Storm Giants}\"). There's a catch: the conch is hidden inside a @spell[Leomund's secret chest] created by the countess, and only she can summon it.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Cloud Giants\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1005\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cloud Giants</span></h1> <p>Before running this part of the adventure, review the information on cloud giants in the Monster Manual. It will help you roleplay the cloud giants in this chapter. One important point to remember is that some cloud giants are good, and some are evil.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Lady of Masks\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1006\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lady of Masks</span></h2> <p>@UUID[Actor.WDyUyhSwWBwZaTiF]{Countess Sansuri} is a greedy and vainglorious giant who lives in the clouds, untethered from reality, convinced that she is the victim of a great injustice and surrounded by jealous enemies who yearn to topple her.</p><p>As a powerful wizard and noble, Sansuri believes it is her duty to rule over others and command their respect. Even so, she has been forced to bow to the will of @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} and the storm giants her whole life. She resents Hekaton for stifling her ambitions, and she lives for the day when the gods finally elevate her kind above storm giants. Internally, Sansuri is fraught with envy and scorn, but she tries to hide those feelings behind a calm, unassuming facade.</p><p>Like many cloud giant nobles, Sansuri keeps a collection of masks. She dons whichever mask best reflects her current mood and switches masks as her mood changes. Her inability to pry useful information out of the bronze dragon has made her very unhappy, so she's wearing her sad mask when the characters arrive.</p><p>Sansuri has little regard for \"puny folk\" and doesn't consider them a threat. How she reacts to the characters depends on the manner in which they approach her castle:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">If the characters attack her castle without provocation or are caught trying to sneak into her home, Sansuri brings her castle's defenses to bear and tries to crush them, capturing those who surrender.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">If the characters approach her castle in a nonthreatening manner, Sansuri instructs her castellan, @UUID[Actor.N3fkxnXaXlHcQb1v]{Cressaro}, to escort them to her audience chamber (@UUID[.0000000000000009#1.-audience-chamber]{area 1}), where she greets them formally.</li></ul><p>In a noncombat situation, Sansuri plays the part of the proud hostess but can't quite hide her impatience. She has no time to entertain unexpected visitors and would prefer to see them quickly on their way. If the characters ask to borrow or use her @UUID[Item.zDgKqy8YpOBW8a8o]{conch of teleportation}, she demands to know why but ultimately refuses to help them, even if they offer to buy it or trade for it. Simply put, she doesn't trust \"puny folk\" and won't lower herself to negotiate with them, nor will she give them the means to reach Maelstrom.</p><p>If the characters pry into her business, she tells them that she's conducting an extensive survey to update her maps of the lands below. If the characters ask about the dragon, Sansuri replies coldly, \"It's not your concern.\" Clever characters might claim to possess knowledge useful to Sansuri, such as the locations of ancient Ostorian way-markers that point the way to long-lost treasures. Sansuri regards any such claims with great suspicion, and ability checks made to deceive her have disadvantage.</p><p>Sansuri attacks characters who are clearly being disrespectful or deceptive. She also turns on those who seem intent on robbing her. If she loses more than half her hit points, Sansuri casts a @spell[fly] spell on herself, retreats to her tower (areas 31–33), and leaves the castle's other denizens to fend for themselves. If her defeat seems inevitable, Sansuri bargains for her life and, under such circumstances, is willing to relinquish her @UUID[Item.zDgKqy8YpOBW8a8o]{conch of teleportation} (see @UUID[.0000000000000009#33.-master-bedchamber]{area 33}). She also gives up the conch to protect the lives of her children (see areas 22–23).</p><p>If the characters are defeated in combat, Sansuri has them stripped of their armor, weapons, and other equipment. Such items are stored in @UUID[.0000000000000009#2.-workshop-and-meeting-room]{area 2} until Sansuri has the time and wherewithal to inspect them more thoroughly with the aid of @spell[detect magic] spells. Dead characters are unceremoniously dropped through the hole in the audience chamber floor. Living captives are confined to cages in the dungeon (@UUID[.0000000000000009#8.-dungeon]{area 8}) and left unguarded. Unless the prisoners manage to escape, Sansuri feeds them to her griffons in @UUID[.0000000000000009#7.-griffon-aviary]{area 7} the next day.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Aarakocra Simulacra\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1007\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Aarakocra Simulacra</span></h2> <p>Years ago, a wounded aarakocra named Jakka landed on Sansuri's cloud castle. Sansuri was struck by the beauty and color of the noble creature, but rather than befriend Jakka, she locked him in a cage and imprisoned him for months while she used @spell[simulacrum] spells to create effigies of him out of ice and snow.

To reach it, characters need an airship, flying mounts, or spells and magic items that grant flight. They can also ask one or more helpful metallic dragons to fly them to Sansuri's castle, although there's rarely a dragon around when they need one (see \"Metallic Dragons\").</p><p>If the characters attempt to conceal their aerial approach, either by hiding among the neighboring clouds or traveling under the cloak of night, they can reach the castle undetected without having to make any sort of check.

The floors on level 1 are made of tightly fitted stone, while the interior floors on levels 2–6 are made of thick, varnished wooden planks supported underneath with heavy crossbeams. The grass lawns on the tower rooftops (areas 26, 27, and 29) grow atop 2 feet of packed earth, beneath which are stone floors.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Cloud\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1013\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cloud.</span></span> The cloud upon which the castle rests is opaque, buoyant, and semisolid, with the consistency and coldness of slush. One can sculpt the cloud to form stairs and other features, and a creature that falls onto the cloud sinks into it without taking damage. Any creature that tries to pass through the cloud can do so, treating it as &amp;Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain}. Inside the cloud, visibility is reduced to zero. The cloud doesn't block sound, however.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Defenses\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1014\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Defenses.</span></span> The castle's crenellated battlements are 10 feet tall and 5 feet wide. Arrow slits are 10 feet tall, 10 feet above the floor, and 5 feet wide, narrowing to 2 feet wide on the outside of the wall. Wooden ballistae (see the \"<a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,8,siege%20equipment,0\">Siege Equipment</a>\" section in chapter 8 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>) are positioned behind several of the arrow slits, angled to fire bolts at flying creatures outside. A giant can aim and fire a ballista with a single action.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Doors\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1015\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Doors.</span></span> Each of Lyn Armaal's doors is 27 feet high and made of ornately carved, 6-inch-thick wood with polished bronze fittings. Door handles are 12 feet above the floor. A Huge giant has no trouble opening a door. A smaller creature can attempt to open a door, provided that creature or some other helpful creature can reach the door's handle and unlatch it. While the handle is unlatched, a creature must use an action to push or pull on the heavy door, opening it with a successful [[/save ability=str dc=14]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check. On a failed check, the door doesn't open.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Illumination\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1016\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Illumination.</span></span> All indoor areas are brightly lit, either by sunlight filtered through windows or arrow slits, or by magical flames (created by @spell[continual flame] spells) that blaze in golden sconces along the walls. A golden sconce is worth 250 gp and weighs 25 pounds. Outdoor areas have natural lighting.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Oversized Furnishings and Objects\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1017\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Oversized Furnishings and Objects.</span></span> Most of the furnishings and other items in Lyn Armaal are sized for cloud giants. Exceptions are noted in the text. Tables, beds, and other room fixtures are typically three times as high, long, and wide as their human-sized equivalents and roughly twenty-seven times the weight. Small and Medium creatures can scuttle under and clamber over giant-sized furniture, treating the spaces they occupy as &amp;Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain}.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Stairs\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1018\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Stairs.</span></span> Staircases within the castle are sized for cloud giants.

Large and smaller creatures treat the staircases as &amp;Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain}.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Telescopes\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1019\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Telescopes.</span></span> Bolted to the battlements are several telescopes that the cloud giants use to spy on the lands below. Each telescope weighs 750 pounds and consists of a 20-foot-long bronze body fitted with transparent crystal magnifying lenses. The telescopes are mounted on steel braces and can be turned and angled to look in different directions, including up or down at a 60-degree angle. The eyepiece of a horizontally level telescope is 20 feet above the floor. Characters who are flying or standing on the shoulders of other characters can use the telescopes to clearly see prominent terrain features and objects hundreds of miles away.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Airship\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1020\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Airship</span></h3> <p>Characters can approach the castle in the dragon cultists' airship (see the \"Airship of a Cult\" section in chapter 4), but given the airship's size, there are only a few places on Lyn Armaal that can accommodate the vessel and bear its weight:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">The courtyard of the aft battery (@UUID[.0000000000000009#6.-aft-battery]{area 6})</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The cloud by the stairs leading up to the gatehouse (@UUID[.0000000000000009#9.-cloud-stair]{area 9})</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The gatehouse's arrival platform (@UUID[.0000000000000009#10.-gatehouse]{area 10})</li><li class=\"rd__li\">Any of the tower rooftop lawns (@UUID[.0000000000000009#26.-port-lawn]{area 26}, 27, or 29)</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Flying Mounts\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1021\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Flying Mounts</span></h3> <p>Characters can secure griffon mounts in Fireshear or hippogriff mounts in Hawk's Nest. Those mounted on hippogriffs can travel 54 miles per day (three 3-hour flights with 1-hour rests in between), while those mounted on griffons can travel 72 miles in the same amount of time. Hippogriffs and griffons are capable of landing in any outdoor area. They can also fly through the openings in the wall of the griffon aviary (@UUID[.0000000000000009#7.-griffon-aviary]{area 7}).

Dragons of the North don't like serving as mounts, however, so characters who aren't extremely persuasive or flattering will need to offer a dragon treasure before it commits to helping them. A young dragon can transport one Medium character, while an adult dragon can transport four Medium characters. Two Small characters can take the place of one Medium character. The dragon can be further bribed into joining the assault on Lyn Armaal, though it expects to receive as its reward the castle itself and all the treasure in it (not counting the @UUID[Item.zDgKqy8YpOBW8a8o]{conch of teleportation} that the characters need to continue their mission).</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Denizens\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1023\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Denizens</span></h2> <p>Despite its grandeur and immense proportions, the castle is fairly self-contained, and loud sounds in one area can easily be heard in other locations. Any adult giant who yells really loud can be heard throughout the castle.</p><p>The Lyn Armaal Roster table summarizes the locations of the inhabitants when the characters approach and indicates how those creatures react when intruders are detected.</p><p>Any @UUID[Actor.HAE4CEfzPv83Hhga]{cloud giant} or @UUID[Actor.faS7ETrUGFcgi83L]{aarakocra simulacrum} can place the castle on alert. A cloud giant does this by bellowing \"To arms!\" at the end of its first turn in combat. An aarakocra simulacrum does it by shrieking loudly at the end of its first turn. Other creatures in the castle have no means to sound an alarm or don't bother doing so.</p><p>When the alarm sounds, the screams of the bronze dragon cease as @UUID[Actor.WDyUyhSwWBwZaTiF]{Countess Sansuri} is drawn away from her interrogation of @UUID[Actor.70ymlDsplvkkfQM4]{Felgolos}. Sansuri moves to a place where she can use a telescope to get a closer look at those who might threaten her. \"Puny folk\" pique her curiosity.

If the characters turn hostile before this meeting can occur, Sansuri dispenses with the formal greeting and helps defend her castle until such time as it's no longer in her best interest to do so (see the \"Lady of Masks\" section near the start of this chapter for more information on Sansuri's tactics).</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Lyn Armaal Roster\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1024\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lyn Armaal Roster</span></h3> <table class=\"w-100 rd__table stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Area</th><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Creature(s)</th><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-8\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\">1</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2\">4 @UUID[Actor.faS7ETrUGFcgi83L]{aarakocra simulacra}</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-8\">The simulacra remain here.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center\">5</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2\">5 @UUID[Actor.HAE4CEfzPv83Hhga]{cloud giants}</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-8\">The giants muster in @UUID[.0000000000000009#6.-aft-battery]{area 6}.

On a typical day, these guards and the ones on active duty operate on alternating shifts. When the castellan decides that a shift is done, he rousts these guards from their slumber and orders them to replace the guards in areas 16, 17, 18, and 24. Relieved guards return here to rest. When an alarm sounds, the sleeping giants awaken, grab their morningstars, and move to @UUID[.0000000000000009#6.-aft-battery]{area 6}.

Two locked manacles bind the dragon's hind legs, preventing him from moving more than a few feet in any direction. He has a locked collar around his neck and a locked iron muzzle covering his snout. The muzzle, the collar, and the manacles are all designed to hold a dragon of his size and aren't useful on creatures of other shapes and sizes. The bonds are strengthened by magic, and as such they can't be broken by physical force. The magic on @UUID[Actor.70ymlDsplvkkfQM4]{Felgolos}'s collar prevents him from using his Change Shape ability, and he can't use his Frightful Presence ability while chained up. While he is muzzled, @UUID[Actor.70ymlDsplvkkfQM4]{Felgolos} can speak with some difficulty, but the range of his breath weapons is reduced to 5 feet. The dragon is bleeding from multiple wounds and has 160 hit points when the characters find him.</p><p>A @spell[knock] spell can unlock the shackles around one of the dragon's legs or unlock the dragon's muzzle or collar. Any of these locks can be picked open using thieves' tools, though it requires an action to do so and a successful [[/save ability=dex dc=20]] check.</p><p>Across from the dragon, stashed in a corner of the room, are three empty iron cages sized for humanoid prisoners. The cages have bars that are 1 inch thick with 4-inch gaps between them. Any party members captured by the cloud giants are stripped of their gear and locked in the cages. The oversized padlock on each cage door is too big to be picked using thieves' tools, but a character outside a cage can use an action to reach into the locking mechanism of the cage's padlock and manually pick the lock, doing so with a successful [[/save ability=dex dc=20]] check. Sansuri keeps the key to the padlocks in her workshop (@UUID[.0000000000000009#2.-workshop-and-meeting-room]{area 2}).</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"The Countess\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1038\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Countess</span></h3> <p>Sansuri carries a large ring of keys that unlock the dragon's bonds. She uses a mithral-tipped spear to torture the dragon during her interrogation, thrusting the spear's tip between the dragon's scales at various \"soft points\" to cause maximum pain. If an alarm sounds in another part of the castle, Sansuri ends the interrogation, frees the griffons from their cages in @UUID[.0000000000000009#7.-griffon-aviary]{area 7}, and makes her way to @UUID[.0000000000000009#6.-aft-battery]{area 6}.

He's also quite clumsy and a bit awkward socially. He means well, however.

In fact, @UUID[Actor.70ymlDsplvkkfQM4]{Felgolos} has a large collection of Zhentarim wagons and isn't afraid to admit it. He won't part with any of them, however, because he considers the wagons and their cargo as his treasure. He targets Zhentarim caravans specifically because he knows the Black Network's sinister reputation and delights in frustrating the Zhents' plans.</p><p>Once he is freed, @UUID[Actor.70ymlDsplvkkfQM4]{Felgolos} offers to remain with the party for the remainder of this part of the adventure but chooses not to accompany them to Maelstrom (see chapter 10, \"@UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000011]{Hold of the Storm Giants}\"), saying that he doesn't want to rile up any more giants for a while. Instead, he returns to one of his many dens—a cave overlooking a river that cuts through the western Starmetal Hills. If the characters require the dragon's assistance at some later time, they can search for him there.

When he isn't tending to his plants, he sometimes looks after Sansuri's two children in his room. Some of their toys lie strewn on the floor, including a chariot big enough for a halfling to ride in and a stuffed, silk-skinned doll as big as a human. Thullen keeps his quarters tidy otherwise.

Standing 6½ feet tall and weighing 250 pounds, each is as big as a powerfully built male human.

If the characters get greedy and ask for more than the conch, Sansuri is willing to part with just about anything else except her spellbook (see @UUID[.0000000000000009#21.-library]{area 21}), her castle, and the @UUID[Item.gB7GURLoCPkD9Qbv]{navigation orb} (see @UUID[.0000000000000009#30.-navigation-dome]{area 30}).

She has no honor, however, and will break her word or attempt to reclaim what's hers as soon as the children are safely returned to her.</p><p>If any harm befalls either child, Sansuri won't rest until those responsible are crushed to a pulp.

This giant doesn't have any rocks to hurl but can substitute five-gallon flasks of acid (range 30/120 ft.), hurling one as an action and dealing 22 ([[/r 4d10]]) acid damage on a hit. Each flask weighs 50 pounds, and there are twelve such flasks on wooden shelves about the room.</p><p>Cut into the floor in one corner of the room are six murder holes, each one big enough for a Small character to squeeze through.

If enemies enter the castle through the main door (@UUID[.0000000000000009#11.-main-gate]{area 11}), the giant can use an action to dump the contents of the vat over the murder holes, allowing the acid to rain down on intruders in the hallway below. Any creature caught in the acid shower must make a [[/save ability=dex dc=15]] saving throw, taking 44 ([[/r 8d10]]) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Blue crystal flute glasses are stored on shelves on either side of a door that leads to the library (@UUID[.0000000000000009#21.-library]{area 21}). Two padded chairs covered in yeti hide with blue-dyed seat cushions are turned to face the table. The chairs flank a marble fireplace carved with images of birds. Above the mantelpiece is a stuffed and mounted aarakocra with blue plumage. This poor creature is the remains of Jakka (see the \"Aarakocra Simulacra\" section earlier in this chapter).</p><p>A @spell[detect magic] spell reveals a faint aura of conjuration magic surrounding the fireplace. Any creature that points at the fireplace and speaks the word \"ild\" causes a magical, crackling fire to erupt within it. The fire lasts for 1 hour before it dies out.

The aarakocra have instructions to attack intruders who disturb the water in the pool (see below). They also come to the aid of the guards in @UUID[.0000000000000009#29.-high-lawn]{area 29}. They otherwise attack only in self-defense or if Sansuri commands them to.</p><p>Looking out over the battlements are three telescopes. Piles of rocks, which the giants use for ammunition, are next to two of the telescopes.</p><p>A fountain with a spout shaped like a silver dragon bound in chains feeds water into a 40-foot-diameter, 5-foot-deep pool near the western wall. Water from the spout is collected in the pool and recycled through the fountain. A @UUID[Actor.wekkhuFyJPVoRBZc]{water elemental} lives in the pool and emerges to attack any intruder that disturbs the water. If the elemental is attacked, the aarakocra simulacra join the fray, coming to its defense.</p><p>Fruit trees grow in a few places, and a pumpkin patch dominates one large area.

A hedge divides the yard, and inside the smaller area is a black-and-white marble chessboard. The chess pieces are all human-sized and look like decorative suits of armor, their helms sporting designs that differentiate them; for example, the kings and queens wear crowns for helms, and the knights have helms resembling griffon heads. The pawns, rooks, bishops, knights, and kings are suits of @UUID[Actor.Uljk8Z1Z0Pil0NbL]{animated armor}, thirty in all. The queens are @UUID[Actor.t8R7Fqm5DiDNOyAL]{helmed horrors}. Since no game is in progress, all of the pieces are in their starting locations.</p><p>The constructs don't attack unless one of them is attacked first, or unless they are commanded to do so by Sansuri or Thullen.

A riot of flowering plants and herbs grow within the greenhouse. The plants are tended by Sansuri's younger brother, @UUID[Actor.O2h08hOFIKBQUNMT]{Count Thullen}. If he's not here, Thullen is either in his quarters (@UUID[.0000000000000009#20.-thullens-bedroom]{area 20}) or checking on his niece and nephew in @UUID[.0000000000000009#23.-playroom]{area 23}. Lurking among the flora are seven @UUID[Actor.KVvZJKFLc7LbksKQ]{awakened shrubs} that guard the greenhouse and protect the other plants.

If all they want is Sansuri's @UUID[Item.zDgKqy8YpOBW8a8o]{conch of teleportation}, he will divulge that Sansuri keeps the conch in her tower bedchamber (@UUID[.0000000000000009#33.-master-bedchamber]{area 33}), though he doesn't know exactly where.</p><p>If the characters seem intent on running amok, Thullen tries to defeat them quickly for the good of his family, calling on the constructs in @UUID[.0000000000000009#27.-starboard-lawn]{area 27} to assist.

The inside wall of the room is painted with a lavish mural of a cloud giant city made up of dozens of joined cloud castles. The domed ceiling is made up of overlapping shells of thin, black metal with glowing shards of crystal set into star-shaped sockets. The crystals represent the stars in the night sky, and the overlapping shells magically reposition themselves so that the artificial sky inside the dome exactly matches the night sky wherever the castle happens to be.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"31.

By touching the replica, Sansuri can recall the larger chest (see \"Treasure\"), causing it to appear within 5 feet of her.

If the characters oppose him, Thullen tries to convince them to leave by allowing the characters to keep whatever treasures they have amassed. If they still refuse to give up control of the castle, he attacks them unless they have Sansuri's children in custody, in which case Thullen cedes control of the castle in exchange for their safe return.

There are certainly other creatures in the North that might try to take it from them, including rival cloud giants and ancient dragons. @UUID[Actor.osMHdhwQplUH432a]{Klauth}, in particular, might try to seize the castle as \"payment\" for helping the characters earlier in the adventure; see the \"Klauthen Vale\" section in chapter 3 for more information on this sly old wyrm.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Character Advancement\"><h4 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1081\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Character Advancement</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span title=\"Page 200\">p200</span></span></span></h4> <p>Once the characters obtain Sansuri's @UUID[Item.zDgKqy8YpOBW8a8o]{conch of teleportation}, a character can attune to it and use it to transport the party to Maelstrom.

The storm giants, reclusive by nature, did their best to discourage lesser giants from destroying the civilizations of the small folk. The death of Queen Neri and the disappearance of @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} have left Maelstrom in disarray, allowing evil giants to run rampant.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} saw signs that his eldest daughters were unfit to claim the @UUID[Item.MSfT5T7iBD5Bey69]{Wyrmskull Throne}, so he made his even-keeled youngest daughter, @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa}, his rightful heir. She has taken her place on the @UUID[Item.MSfT5T7iBD5Bey69]{Wyrmskull Throne}, but with the ordning shattered, she doesn't have the power to keep the evil giant lords in line. She relies on two storm giants for counsel: her uncle, Uthor (Hekaton's younger brother), and the wise, matronly @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}. Unfortunately, neither of them has much respect for small folk. In that regard, @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} is alone. Like her dearly departed mother, @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} believes that small folk are cleverer and mightier than most giants give them credit for, and as a child, she visited their shores in the company of her mother and has great affection for them.</p><p>In this part of their mission, the characters use their @UUID[Item.zDgKqy8YpOBW8a8o]{conch of teleportation} (obtained in a previous chapter) to teleport to Maelstrom. Once there, they must make their way to @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Princess Serissa} and win her confidence. She wants to believe that her father is alive. She also wants to believe that the characters are resourceful and strong enough to find and rescue @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton}, despite what Uthor and @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} whisper. If the characters convince @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} that they can help, she shows them a clue found near the corpse of her mother: a wooden coin that leads the characters into conflict with the Kraken Society (as discussed in chapter 11, \"@UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000012]{Caught in the Tentacles}\").</p><p>Standing in the characters' way are @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa}'s siblings, @UUID[Actor.IrIRmSa9G1ZN7IXB]{Mirran} and @UUID[Actor.89WgkGAR6oRqRhC0]{Nym}, who do everything in their power to turn @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} against the adventurers and prove to their younger sibling that small folk can't be trusted and must be wiped out. The characters also encounter @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} again. To prove their true worth to the storm giants, the characters must expose the dragon who hides in their midst. The dragon flees when her true nature is revealed, and the characters don't encounter @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} again until they confront her in her desert lair (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000013]{chapter 12}).</p><p>Characters who have no interest in intrigue might try to plunder the stronghold or do away with members of the royal family. Any such act turns @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} against the characters and plays right into @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s hands.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Storm Giants\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1083\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Storm Giants</span></h1> <p>Before running this part of the adventure, review the information on storm giants in the Monster Manual.

For centuries, it has been the stronghold of the world's most powerful storm giant kings. The undersea fortress of @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} is carved into a reef. Four rocky towers covered in barnacles and coral reach upward, and between them is a large sinkhole that descends into the heart of the fortress. A natural phenomenon sometimes causes the ocean currents to form a great whirlpool with enough strength to draw ships down into it. These vessels are torn apart as they are pulled down, and the wreckage is deposited at the bottom of the sinkhole, where hulking crabs pick through it for their storm giant masters.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Maelstrom: General Features\"><h4 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1085\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Maelstrom: General Features</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span title=\"Page 202\">p202</span></span></span></h4> <p>Even though the storm giants stronghold Maelstrom lies deep beneath the Trackless Sea, it isn't entirely filled with water.

Some air-filled areas contain pools of water; a pool fills a depression in the floor and is tinted blue on the map. Submerged areas are tinted blue from wall to wall. Characters who can't breathe underwater must hold their breath in a submerged area. While submerged, they are also susceptible to the effect of water pressure (see the \"@UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000011#water-pressure]{Water Pressure}\" section). Rules for underwater combat appear in the \"<a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,9,underwater%20combat,0\">Underwater Combat</a>\" section in chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Anemone Chests\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1087\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Anemone Chests.</span></span> The storm giants cultivate 10-foot-tall, 10-foot-wide anemones that can survive out of the water and have hollow cavities within them. The giants use the anemones as treasure chests and for waste disposal. Edible organic matter placed in an anemone chest is slowly digested over a period of days; inedible or inorganic matter is not. When a storm giant touches on of these anemones, it opens at the top. Any other creature that comes into contact with an anemone must make a [[/save ability=dex dc=10]] saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 11 ([[/r 2d10]]) poison damage from the anemone's poisonous tendrils. A character can trick an anemone into opening by touching it and succeeding on a [[/save ability=int dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Nature]) check. If the check fails, the anemone doesn't open, and the character must make the saving throw. A chest remains open for 1 minute, then closes. An anemone chest has AC 5 and 20 hit points.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Ceilings\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1088\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ceilings.</span></span> The stronghold has slick, rough-hewn walls that don't offer a lot of handholds, so climbing them without gear requires a successful [[/save ability=str dc=20]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Crystal Windows\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1089\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Crystal Windows.</span></span> Some rooms have oval windows made of thick, transparent crystal. These windows were designed to withstand tremendous amounts of pressure and force, and aren't easily broken. Each window has AC 15, 60 hit points, a damage threshold of 20, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Breaking a window causes seawater to pour into the stronghold, flooding air-filled chambers and lower levels quickly. Doing this has no effect on storm giants, who can breathe water as easily as they breathe air, but creatures that can't breathe water aren't likely to survive for long without the aid of @spell[water breathing] spells or similar magic.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Doors and Secret Doors\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1090\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Doors and Secret Doors.</span></span> The giant-sized doors throughout Maelstrom are 30 feet tall and made of barnacle-covered stone with rusty iron hinges. Their handles are 13 feet above the floor. Secret doors are similar in size but lack visible hinges and handles. A Huge giant has no trouble opening either type of door. A smaller creature can attempt to open a door if that creature or some other helpful creature can reach the door's handle and unlatch it. While the handle is unlatched, a creature must use an action to push or pull on the heavy door, opening it with a successful [[/save ability=str dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check. On a failed check, the door doesn't open. The doors aren't airtight and can't hold back water. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (&amp;Reference[skill=Perception]) score of 15 or higher spot a secret door as they move near its location. A character can also find it by searching for secret doors and succeeding on a [[/save ability=wis dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Perception]) check.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Giant Clams\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1091\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giant Clams.</span></span> Giant clams appear in several of the stronghold's chambers.

Maelstrom is located on the sea floor between Ruathym, the Whalebones, and the Korinn Archipelago. Any ship that sails over Maelstrom encounters a giant whirlpool, which inexorably draws the vessel into the depths. The ship's hull is torn apart, its wreckage sucked to the bottom of a sinkhole in the heart of the stronghold (@UUID[.0000000000000010#1.-vortex-and-sinkhole]{area 1}). Creatures aboard the vessel must make a [[/save ability=con dc=20]] saving throw, taking 55 ([[/r 10d10]]) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. There's no air in the sinkhole, so characters who survive the shipwreck must hold their breath, locate an air pocket, or use magic to breathe. Characters who are drawn down into the depths must also contend with water pressure.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Water Pressure\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1097\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Water Pressure</span></h3> <p>Creatures and vehicles at Maelstrom's depth take 7 ([[/r 2d6]]) bludgeoning damage per minute from water pressure unless they are adapted or built to withstand this environment.

(On the surface of the water, the vortex manifests as a half-mile-wide whirlpool powerful enough to drag ships to their doom.) The sinkhole has a drain at the bottom.

Heedless of @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s words, @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} is inclined to give the characters the benefit of the doubt. When it becomes clear to @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} that @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa}'s fondness for small folk can't be undone with mere words, the dragon begins plotting her exit strategy.</p><p>Casting @spell[dispel magic] on @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} doesn't reveal her true form, but contact with an @spell[antimagic field] causes her to revert to her dragon form.

Lord Drylund's wealthy patrons are the movers and shakers of Yartar, and he wants to impress them and place them in his debt. They come to his riverboat day and night, exchanging coins for wooden gambling chips called \"golden geese.\" They dine on the finest prepared food, dance to marvelous music, and gamble away their chips at Lord Drylund's tables, all under the watchful eye of his chief of security, the wizard @UUID[Actor.r6K7efO8SiaTP2w5]{Pow Ming}.</p><p>Tracking the wooden coin to its source requires some investigation and, perhaps, a little help from one or more factions.

Ascertaining where the coin came from requires a period of downtime, during which a character can show the coin around, make inquiries at gambling houses and festhalls, and bribe local guilds for information. A character must spend a certain amount of gold per day to cover expenses. After [[/r 1d4 + 1]] days, the character can make an Intelligence (&amp;Reference[skill=Investigation]) check. On a success, the character learns where the coin came from. A failed check means that the character's investigation has reached a dead end, but he or she can try again by spending the requisite amount of time and gold. The DC of the check depends on where the investigation is conducted. Cities have more people to talk to and more leads to follow than towns or villages, but the expenses are higher. This information is summarized in the Finding the Golden Goose table.</p><p>You can rule that an investigation automatically fails if it is conducted in a particularly isolated location, such as the islands of Ruathym or Tuern, where it's unlikely that the characters will find anyone who is familiar with the festhalls and gambling havens of Yartar.

As it plies the Trackless Sea, the top of the forward stabilizing fin remains above the water while the aft tentacles trail behind underwater.

Merrow harpoons have ropes made of tightly woven kelp attached to them so that they can be reeled in. If it misses with its harpoon attack, a merrow can use its next action to reel in the harpoon. If another creature is holding onto the harpoon, the merrow regains the weapon if it wins a contested Strength check. If characters take cover to avoid harpoon attacks, or if the merrow are unable to hurl their harpoons, the merrow crawl up onto the deck and attack with their teeth and claws, pursuing prey into the <i>Morkoth</i>'s lower deck if necessary.</p><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img alt=\"Map 11.2: The Morkoth\" class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/104-skt11-06.webp\" title=\"Map 11.2: The Morkoth\"/>\n</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner\">Map 11.2: The Morkoth</div></div></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n<img alt=\"Player Version\" class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://cdn.5e.tools/2024/img/adventure/SKT/105-1199.webp\" title=\"Player Version\"/>\n</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner\">Player Version</div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"1.

The 28-foot-tall giant appears frozen in time, his eyes open and staring blindly into the sky. He is effectively &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] and &amp;Reference[condition=unconscious] while bound in this manner. Four chains bind him. The chains are secured to the hull and must be broken to release the giant from his stasis or free him from the ship's hold. Striking a chain alerts any <i>Morkoth</i> crew members not already engaged in battle.</p><p>Each chain has AC 20, 10 hit points, and immunity to all damage except bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from adamantine or magic weapons. If all four chains are broken, Hekaton's stasis ends and he is no longer &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] or &amp;Reference[condition=unconscious].

The last thing he remembers was being ambushed during a meeting with small folk, whom he was led to believe were representatives of the Lords' Alliance. (In fact, they were Kraken Society operatives in disguise.) The only individual aboard the <i>Morkoth</i> that Hekaton recognizes is @UUID[Actor.rJVS5HQseSuFTcv4]{Rool} the half-orc, who was part of the group that ambushed him.</p><p>Hekaton rises to his full height and begins lashing out against small folk indiscriminately, shouting, \"Lords' Alliance indeed!

That character must succeed on a [[/save ability=cha dc=18]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Persuasion]) check to calm down the king. If the check fails, the character's words fall on deaf ears. If the character mentions @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} by name, the check is made with advantage.</p><p>Hekaton has no idea that his court has been thrown into upheaval and that evil forces are conspiring to usurp his throne. Only when the battle aboard the <i>Morkoth</i> has ended can the characters bring Hekaton up to date on recent developments. Regardless of what he is told, the king remains skeptical until he has had a chance to speak with his daughter, @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa}, and his brother, Uthor. He urges the characters to return to Maelstrom with him. Characters can either use Hekaton's conch to teleport themselves and the storm giant king to Maelstrom, or they can follow Hekaton as he dives into the water and swims home.</p><p>If the characters want to delay their departure, Hekaton agrees to stay around long enough for them to search the <i>Morkoth</i> or to take care of other matters. For example, the characters might need to conclude some business with the captain of the ship that brought them here, or they might need time to gather belongings from their airship. If Hekaton and the characters remain in the vicinity of the <i>Morkoth</i> for more than 1 hour, they are present when @UUID[Actor.hzFTNht0gQVKiZaT]{Slarkrethel} shows up (see \"The Kraken Cometh\" section at the end of this chapter).</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"4.

With the help of his scrying pool, Hekaton figures out where @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} has gone to ground. Seated upon the @UUID[Item.MSfT5T7iBD5Bey69]{Wyrmskull Throne}, Hekaton summons the adventurers before him, thanks them for their help thus far, and asks them to join him as he takes the fight to @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} by storming the dragon's lair in the desert of Anauroch.</p><p>If the characters were unable to rescue the storm giant king, or if Hekaton didn't survive, @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Princess Serissa} vows to avenge her father's death, swearing that @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s deception will not go unpunished. She reaches out to the adventurers one more time, imploring them to join her as she confronts the dragon.</p><p>An ancient blue dragon is more than a match for a party of 10th-level adventurers, but the characters have storm giants watching their backs. Hekaton or @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} also gives each character a @UUID[Item.jMy5YgVcoC4jQqex]{potion of giant size} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000014]{appendix B}) from the royal treasury, enabling them to face the dragon as true giants when the time comes. The storm giants describe the effect and duration of the potions, but they leave it to the characters to decide if and when to use them. The characters can quaff their potions before they enter @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s lair or wait until they are about to engage the dragon in battle. Conversely, one or more characters might prefer to use the potions only as a last resort.</p><p>Hekaton or @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} also gives the party a @UUID[Item.2x4MFP0xz5xUTOsI]{claw of the wyrm rune} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000014]{appendix B}) recovered from a shipwreck near Maelstrom. Like the potions, this item is a gift; the characters can do with it what they will.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Finding Iymrith\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1240\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Finding Iymrith</span></h1> <p>The storm giants bear the burden of finding the dragon so that the characters can focus on preparing themselves for the final showdown. Hekaton and @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} know that blue dragons favor desert surroundings, and it doesn't take much research for them to discover that @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} has a reputation in the North. The storm giants learn the following facts about their nemesis:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">@UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} is an ancient blue dragon known as the \"Doom of the Desert.\" She is also called the \"Dragon of Statues\" because she creates living statues (actually gargoyles) to guard her lair.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">Her lair is a ruined amphitheater half-buried in the cold desert sands northeast of Ascore, an ancient and abandoned dwarven city.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">She is a spellcaster and, like all blue dragons, is immune to lightning damage.</li></ul><p>Armed with this information, Hekaton (or @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa}) leaves @UUID[Actor.ZJQLAPDcsc4lQGnr]{Imperator Uthor} in charge of Maelstrom and sets out with four storm giant bodyguards named @UUID[Actor.nOI2ujSeY4VOoqro]{Nimir}, @UUID[Actor.mCdwwwzvCsHs4OVB]{Orlekto}, @UUID[Actor.FOBm0I1DlzVlpvVe]{Shaldoor}, and @UUID[Actor.AoDG99kAXD5gf66d]{Vaasha} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000016]{appendix D} for statistics) to confront @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}. The characters are invited to join them. @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} has 330 hit points at full health but otherwise has the statistics of a typical storm giant. If @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} leads the attackers, see @UUID[.0000000000000010#15.-throne-room]{area 15} in chapter 10 for modifications to her statistics.</p><p>The storm giants ride whales to the Whalebones. At the islands, they mount rocs and fly the remaining distance to Anauroch. Once they are within half a mile of @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s lair, the storm giants dismount and approach on foot, leaving the rocs to perch atop rocky outcroppings and wait for their return. Characters can ride with the giants, or they can use some other method of conveyance—it's up to them.</p><p>Storm giants aren't stealthy and would prefer to stage a direct assault on @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s lair, but they will adjust their tactics based on the desires of the characters. If the characters favor a stealthy approach, the giants offer to create a distraction so that the characters can enter @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s lair undetected. Such a plan stands a better chance of succeeding if the characters refrain from drinking their <i>potions of giant size</i> until after they have infiltrated the lair.</p><p>It's best if Hekaton (or @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa}) remains an NPC under your control. You can have your players run the other storm giants if you prefer (and if they would enjoy doing so). Photocopy the storm giant stat blocks at the end of this chapter and distribute them among the players in your group. If your group includes more than four players, not every player will receive a storm giant NPC to play, and that's okay. Accompanying the giants' stat blocks are roleplaying notes that the players can use to portray the giants accurately. One of the giants (@UUID[Actor.mCdwwwzvCsHs4OVB]{Orlekto}) has sinister ulterior motives that might come into play during the events of this chapter. If you have a player who's particularly good at roleplaying underhanded characters, consider giving @UUID[Actor.mCdwwwzvCsHs4OVB]{Orlekto} to that player.</p><p>You can have all storm giants act on the same initiative count, or have the players roll initiative for each storm giant. The former approach expedites combat; the latter leads to a battle with more verisimilitude.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Harshnag Returns!\"><h4 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1241\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Harshnag Returns!</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span title=\"Page 226\">p226</span></span></span></h4> <p>If the characters decide to confront @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} without storm giant reinforcements, consider having @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} appear out of the blue and offer to fight by their side. A giant of few words, @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} doesn't talk much about how he survived the destruction of the Temple of Annam. The truth is that he escaped certain death by leaping into the oracle chamber. There he was trapped until a friendly wizard appeared and rescued him with the aid of a @spell[teleport] spell. @UUID[Actor.qwU7Qu3wExZQTfk0]{Harshnag} declines to reveal this helpful wizard's identity. The wizard could be Elminster of Shadowdale, Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep, the Harper archmage Krowen Valharrow (see the \"Everlund\" section in chapter 3), an ancient spellcasting dragon in humanoid form, or some other character from your campaign.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Iymrith's Lair\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1242\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Iymrith's Lair</span></h1> <p>The Doom of the Desert has claimed an enormous, abandoned amphitheater in the desert as her lair (shown on map 12.1). Beneath the amphitheater lie chambers where the blue dragon sleeps and hides her treasure. When the characters approach @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s lair for the first time, read or paraphrase the following boxed text aloud to the players.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"></span></span><p>Your long journey ends here, in the desert. A churning cauldron of black clouds fills the sky as thunder peals and lightning flashes. Half buried in the cold dunes is a crumbling amphitheater adorned with statues, many of them broken, the rest worn smooth by wind and sand. Two large trebuchets stand atop the ruins. Where cheers once rang out across a great city, now a solemn fortress stands before you, waiting for you to draw near.</p></div><p>The dry thunderstorm is the dragon's work—a regional effect (see the blue dragon entry in the Monster Manual) that stretches for 6 miles in every direction. The storm has no effect on the battle as it unfolds; it's simply a reflection of @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s mood.</p><p>Storm giants who stride boldly toward the amphitheater with weapons in hand draw fire from the trebuchets (see @UUID[.0000000000000012#1.-amphitheater-and-environs]{area 1}). The characters can let the storm giants bear the brunt of these attacks while they approach from another direction, or they can join the giants in their direct assault. When storm giants or characters of giant size come within 1,000 feet of the amphitheater, the gargoyles notice them and fire the trebuchets. The giants can hurl lightning at the gargoyles and trebuchets once they get within 500 feet of them.</p><p>If a storm giant or a character of giant size stands in the amphitheater and loudly challenges @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}, the dragon's ego gets the better of her, and she responds to the challenge by crawling out of her lair to destroy her challengers. Otherwise, she remains hidden in @UUID[.0000000000000012#3.-serpents-of-the-sands]{area 3} and lets her gargoyles soften up her enemies.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} can use her lair actions within the amphitheater as well as in the dungeon underneath it. The dragon doesn't waste her lightning breath on storm giants; similarly, the storm giants know that their lightning strikes have no effect on @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}. The giants didn't bring any rocks with them, but they can hurl chunks of sandstone torn from @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s own amphitheater.</p><p>If @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} is drawn to the surface and reduced to 240 hit points or fewer, she retreats to the dungeon level and makes her final stand there. She can collapse tunnels (see the \"@UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s Lair: General Features\" sidebar) as well as burrow new ones, as needed.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Iymrith's Lair: General Features\"><h4 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1243\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Iymrith's Lair: General Features</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span title=\"Page 227\">p227</span></span></span></h4> <p>The dragon's lair consists of a sandstone amphitheater surrounded by sand and a few ruined outbuildings, as well as a dungeon level below the amphitheater. The general features of @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s lair are summarized below.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Dungeon Architecture\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1244\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dungeon Architecture.</span></span> The dungeon level contains worked areas and rough-hewn areas:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">Worked areas have flat sandstone ceilings 40 feet high, with connecting tunnels that are 20 feet high. They have brick walls with sand and clay behind them, and floors covered with sandstone tiles.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">Rough-hewn areas were excavated by the dragon from clay and sand, and have ceilings that range in height from 20 to 30 feet.</li></ul><p>In her dragon form, @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} can move through passages that are 30 feet wide without impediment. She can squeeze through passages that are 20 feet wide. Openings narrower than 20 feet are too small for the dragon to squeeze through, but @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} can effectively burrow new passages or widen existing ones, moving through the clay and sand at her burrowing speed.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Collapsible Passages\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1245\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Collapsible Passages.</span></span> Dotted lines enclose these locations on the map. @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} has weakened the ceilings in these places so that she can collapse them, either to cut off escape routes or to trap intruders. A creature can trigger a collapse by dealing 10 damage or more to the ceiling with a single attack or spell effect. The collapse renders the passage impassable until the sand and stone are cleared away, which requires 250 hours of work. (Multiple creatures working together can reduce the amount of time accordingly.) Any creature in the marked section of tunnel when it collapses must make a [[/save ability=dex dc=15]] saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 ([[/r 4d10]]) bludgeoning damage from falling stone and is buried under stone and sand. While buried, the creature is &amp;Reference[condition=prone] and &amp;Reference[condition=blinded]. It also can't breathe and has &amp;Reference[rule=totalcover]{total cover} against attacks and other effects that might target it.</p><p>A burrowing creature (such as a blue dragon) can move through the collapsed area at its burrowing speed, leaving no tunnel in its wake as the sand fills in behind it. A buried creature that doesn't have a burrowing speed can, at the start of its turn, make a [[/save ability=str dc=15]] (&amp;Reference[skill=Athletics]) check. If the check succeeds, the creature can pull itself in one direction or the other at a rate of 1 foot for every 5 feet of movement spent. If that movement isn't enough to exit the collapsed area, the creature can repeat the check on its next turn. A creature standing at either end of the collapsed area can use its action to pull a buried creature out of the area, provided the buried creature is within reach (no ability check required).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Illumination\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1246\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Illumination.</span></span> @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} uses &amp;Reference[rule=darkvision] to see in the dungeon level.

The walls have abundant cracks and other handholds, enabling them to be climbed with ease. @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} cut a swath through the northeast section of the amphitheater, leaving a rubble-filled path that leads to an open sinkhole and conceals another one that lies along the route (see \"Sinkholes\").</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Gargoyles and Trebuchets\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1249\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gargoyles and Trebuchets</span></h3> <p>Thirty @UUID[Actor.a1rKDCtMM4XgcFqB]{gargoyles} inhabit the amphitheater. Twenty-two of them are perched on stone plinths, waiting to swoop down and attack intruders. The eight remaining gargoyles operate the wooden trebuchets—four per weapon. Two gargoyles use their actions to load a trebuchet while another two use their actions to aim it. Once a trebuchet is loaded and aimed, one of the gargoyles uses its next action to fire the weapon. This routine allows a trebuchet to be loaded, aimed, and fired every other round. For trebuchet rules and statistics, see the \"<a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,8,siege%20equipment,0\">Siege Equipment</a>\" section in chapter 8 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Mystics' Camp\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1250\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mystics' Camp</span></h3> <p>Three tents surround a smoldering campfire southeast of the amphitheater.

The light doesn't extend beyond the room. @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} uses this hole to enter and exit her lair, and her enormous tracks can be seen coming and going from an even larger room to the north (@UUID[.0000000000000012#3.-serpents-of-the-sands]{area 3}), from which chanting can be heard and torchlight seen.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"3.

Before @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} claimed it as her own, this room was once a secret temple belonging to a sect of desert-dwelling yuan-ti mystics called the Serpents of the Sands. These mystics worship Dendar the Night Serpent (see the yuan-ti entry in the Monster Manual for more information on this deity). @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} invited the mystics here to contact their demon-god, hoping it might provide guidance on how to crush her enemies. Because she has become desperate, @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} is willing to trust the mystics' interpretations of the Night Serpent's whispers, which she doesn't understand.</p><p>Floor-to-ceiling piles of sand have been pushed up in three of the room's corners. One of the piles conceals a hole in the western wall (see \"Dragon Bolt-Holes\"). Unless @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} was drawn to the surface and defeated there, the ancient blue dragon is lurking under the pile of sand in the southeast corner of the room. Only her eyes and her horn are visible, and only to characters who have a passive Wisdom (&amp;Reference[skill=Perception]) score of 17 or higher. Any character who searches that corner of the room spots the dragon automatically.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000015]{appendix C}) avails herself of her lair actions here.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Demonic Snake Statue\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1255\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Demonic Snake Statue</span></h3> <p>At the north end of the room is an alabaster statue carved to look like the head and neck of a giant demonic snake erupting from a block of stone. The block is 10 feet high, and the serpent is another 10 feet taller still, with two gleaming eyes of polished obsidian (see \"Treasure\"). Its fanged mouth is open as it glares down at a 20-foot-diameter hole in the sandstone floor. The hole represents the top of an 800-foot-deep shaft, the bottom quarter of which is filled with sand and old bones (previous sacrifices to Dendar the Night Serpent). Standing around the edge of the hole are three @UUID[Actor.AuMFpm2Nojd7BfTa]{yuan-ti purebloods} wearing desert robes and six @UUID[Actor.7lluWNAfQ5K9G89L]{yuan-ti malisons}. Two of the malisons are type 1 (human body with a snake head), two are type 2 (human head and body, with snakes for arms), and one is type 3 (human head and upper body with a serpentine lower body instead of legs). The yuan-ti chant a vile prayer, at the end of which one pureblood leaps into the shaft to his death. His sacrifice causes faint, prophetic whispers to rise from the depths, speaking in the Abyssal tongue. Any character within earshot who understands Abyssal can translate the demonic whispers:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"></span></span><p><i>Wrack and ruin, flash and thunder,</i></p><p><i>Let them claim the dragon's plunder;</i></p><p><i>Death is close!

Rather than anger her with the truth, the yuan-ti lie and tell the dragon that she must face her enemy in battle. From this, @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} concludes that she must kill the storm giant leader to destroy any hope of lasting peace between giants and the small folk. Once the dragon leaves, the yuan-ti attempt to flee the dragon's lair by the safest route, attacking anyone in their way.</p><p>A yuan-ti that is captured and interrogated tries to win its freedom by offering useful information about the dragon's hoard.

Each slam attack deals 18 ([[/r 3d8 + 5]]) bludgeoning damage, and the elementals' whirlwind attack deals 20 ([[/r 4d8 + 2]]) bludgeoning damage (half damage on a successful save, as normal). When an air elemental is destroyed, the gold coins contained within it tumble to the floor (see \"Treasure\").</p><p>The most prized treasures of @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s hoard are contained in six stone sarcophagi buried 10 feet under the sandy floor and scattered about the room.

The @spell[sequester] spell on a given sarcophagus ends when a creature comes in direct contact with it. A creature that spends an hour digging in this cavern has a 10 percent chance of finding a sarcophagus.

She digs up purple worm nests under the sands of the desert, steals the eggs, and brings them back to her lair. When the eggs hatch, she confines the wormlings here and feeds them a healthy diet of meat so that they grow up big and strong.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} has converted a 10-foot-deep, T-shaped pit in the middle of the room into a purple wormling \"playpen.\" The pit currently holds thirty squirming @UUID[Actor.QBgGbvkK1HeF0sCg]{purple wormlings} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000015]{appendix C}). Although they are too small to burrow or climb out of the pit, the wormlings eagerly attack other creatures that enter the pit, including any creature that falls in through the sinkhole above (see the \"Sinkholes\" section in @UUID[.0000000000000012#1.-amphitheater-and-environs]{area 1}).</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Adventure Conclusion\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1261\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adventure Conclusion</span></h1> <p>@UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} is too proud to abandon her lair and fights to the death to defend it. The characters' role in the death of @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} forces Hekaton to admit that he has misjudged the small folk. His beloved wife once told him that if giants and small folk could learn to coexist peacefully and help one another, the world would be better off. Moved by the party's heroism, Hekaton admits that he should have heeded Neri's words. \"Storm giants and small folk can work together,\" he proclaims, \"to create a better world, free from the tyranny of dragons.\" He vows to honor the characters and his wife by allying with the small folk against other draconic threats. This, he believes, is the test that Annam the All-Father has thrust upon him—and this alliance, he hopes, will restore the ordning as it was.</p><p>Whether or not Hekaton is correct is up to you. Seeing giants and small folk working together to destroy a common foe might inspire Annam the All-Father to elevate storm giants to the top of the ordning once more, or the order of giants might remain an open question. In any case, the death of @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} has no effect on the machinations of the evil giant lords of the North who aim to win their gods' favor and rise to the top of the ordning. The characters might be moved to confront and defeat these few remaining giant lords. Hekaton thinks that's a good idea and does nothing to hinder their efforts.</p><p>If @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} participated in the battle against @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} in her father's place, she thanks them for their heroism and, like her father, looks forward to future cooperation between small folk and giants. @UUID[Actor.yb5AhKABznNDCewW]{Serissa} likewise has no qualms about letting the characters deal with the evil giant lords who still threaten the North. She is eager to return to Maelstrom and tell the tale of @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s defeat, knowing this will lure giants back to her court.</p><p>Powerful evil dragons such as @UUID[Actor.osMHdhwQplUH432a]{Klauth} and @UUID[Actor.WGtSRFMDx8MO8EcC]{Claugiyliamatar} are hardly saddened by the death of @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}, but they aren't pleased to see giants and small folk working together. They bide their time, as old dragons do, and wait to see how long the alliance lasts.</p><p>Although @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith} meets her end in this adventure, the blue dragon's legacy lives on in the form of her offspring (see the \"Ascore\" section in chapter 3). They turn on each other, with the victor claiming @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}'s lair and the title of \"Doom of the Desert.\"</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Character Advancement\"><h4 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1262\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Character Advancement</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span title=\"Page 230\">p230</span></span></span></h4> <p>With the defeat of @UUID[Actor.lJ97cIJhzroxbl5E]{Iymrith}, the characters gain a level.

If any of the characters are affiliated with a faction, such as the Harpers, you can guide them toward Bryn Shander, Goldenfields, or Triboar by having a representative of that faction give them a quest. With the growing threat of giants in the North, the quest might be as straightforward as protecting the location against a possible giant attack.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Lost Mine of Phandelver\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1264\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lost Mine of Phandelver</span></h1> <p><i>Lost Mine of Phandelver</i> is an adventure in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons <i>Starter Set</i>, designed to take characters from 1st to 5th level. Characters who complete it are at the right level to begin <i>Trovão do Rei das Tempestades</i>, and Triboar is their ideal starting point (see chapter 2). The trick is to get them from Phandalin to Triboar, which lies east along a trail that cuts across grasslands and foothills. You can simply declare that the party makes the uneventful journey, or you can offer some reason why they would want to visit Triboar. The town is a good place for them to resupply, upgrade their gear, sell their loot, and find new adventures. If those aren't reasons enough, here are a few hooks tied to NPCs in Phandalin that you can use to direct the characters toward Triboar.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Lionshield Delivery\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1265\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lionshield Delivery</span></h3> <p>Linene Graywind, who runs the trading post in Phandalin on behalf of a mercantile company, the Lionshield Coster, has a colleague, Alaestra Ulgar, who lives in Triboar with her business partner, @UUID[Actor.ByZDa0ugm2BAxNK3]{Narth Tezrin}. Linene has written a letter to her friend, describing recent tribulations in Phandalin, and asks the characters to deliver it. In a note attached to the letter, Linene asks Alaestra to reward her messengers with an old gray bag stitched with animal designs.

In the letter, Harbin demands that the lord protector do a better job of patrolling the territory between their two settlements. He reprimands Darathra for allowing orcs to infest the hills near Phandalin. Unknown to Harbin, Darathra is a member of the Harpers.

If you use <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> as a springboard into this adventure, you must change the timing of events so that the <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> story and the events that precipitate <i>Trovão do Rei das Tempestades</i> happen concurrently, with Annam the All-Father breaking the ordning to stir the giants before Tiamat is brought into the world.</p><p>Early in <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i>, the characters join a caravan traveling from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep. By the time they reach Waterdeep, they should be 5th level. You can use the party's arrival in Waterdeep to shift attention away from the <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> story by dropping reports of giant sightings near the temple-farm of Goldenfields. The Emerald Enclave is looking for adventurers to help patrol Goldenfields' borders. If the characters take the bait, Goldenfields becomes the starting point for this adventure (see @UUID[.0000000000000002#goldenfields]{chapter 2}). Although you forgo most of <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> in favor of this new adventure, there's nothing stopping you from returning to <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> later.</p><p>Part of <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> takes place in Skyreach Castle, a flying fortress belonging to a cloud giant named Blagothkus. You can make him a pivotal figure in this adventure by having his castle appear when the characters are around 7th or 8th level, giving them a chance to meet the evil cloud giant and convince him to aid their cause. The characters might also want to confront him after meeting the ghost of his dead son, Eigeron, in @UUID[.0000000000000004#eigerons-ghost]{chapter 4}, \"@UUID[JournalEntry.ddbMWWK3PqXmCjQ7.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004]{The Chosen Path}.\" The shattering of the ordning has the following effects on Blagothkus:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">The cloud giant is eager to dispose of his Cult of the Dragon allies, use their money to buy the loyalty of lesser giants, and wage war against dragonkind. If the characters help him rid Skyreach Castle of the cultists and their white dragon ally, the giant pledges to help them in return and offers them one-third of the cult's spoils. Blagothkus honors his agreements as long as the characters pose no threat to him and he gets his way. If they have an airship with Cult of the Dragon members aboard (see the \"Airship of a Cult\" section in chapter 4), these cultists ally with the ones aboard Skyreach Castle.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">Blagothkus knows that @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} has disappeared and suspects that dragons are somehow responsible. Although he has no proof to corroborate his suspicions, Blagothkus sees dragon conspiracies everywhere and is convinced that evil dragons would pounce on the chance to throw giant society into chaos. Although he's eager to see the ordning restored with cloud giants at its apex, he can be convinced to use his flying fortress to help the characters locate @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} if he's told that one or more dragons orchestrated the king's abduction.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">Although they share a disdain for dragons, Blagothkus and @UUID[Actor.WDyUyhSwWBwZaTiF]{Countess Sansuri} are bitter rivals. If the characters intend to confront Sansuri (see chapter 9, \"Castle of the Cloud Giants\"), Blagothkus offers to join the characters and help them thwart her machinations so that he, not she, can win the favor of the gods and elevate cloud giants to the top of the ordning.</li></ul><p>Blagothkus bears no ill will toward small folk, but his desire to rekindle the ancient war between giants and dragons could have devastating consequences for small folk settlements up and down the Sword Coast.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Princes of the Apocalypse\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1269\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Princes of the Apocalypse</span></h1> <p><i>Princes of the Apocalypse</i> is a stand-alone adventure that takes place in and around the Sumber Hills in the Dessarin Valley, a lightly settled region of caravan towns, isolated homesteads, and wilderness. Four evil elemental cults have taken refuge there and are building secret temples in the ruins of a dungeon complex beneath the hills. By the time the characters reach 5th level, they will have visited several settlements in the valley, explored ruins in the Sumber Hills, and defeated a number of low- to middle-rank elemental cultists.</p><p>You can transition the characters from <i>Princes of the Apocalypse</i> to this adventure by having them defend the town of Triboar from a giant attack. In this scenario, Triboar becomes the starting point for this adventure (see chapter 2), and the characters are pulled away from the threat of Elemental Evil to focus on the giant threat instead. Here are a few hooks to lure the characters to Triboar, if they aren't there already.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--2\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Harper Sympathizer\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1270\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Harper Sympathizer</span></h3> <p>Endrith Vallivoe, a retired caravan merchant living in the village of Red Larch, is friendly toward the Harpers.

Characters who head north to investigate can see that the reports are true. At one damaged farm, the characters encounter halflings who lost an orchard of olive trees and most of their livestock to hill giants. The Skittermarsh clan has gathered its remaining livestock (a sickly cow and four hungry goats) and packed its belongings on three mules with the intention of relocating to Triboar. The family matriarch, Misty Skittermarsh, offers the characters a 100 gp gem if they escort her family to Triboar.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Using the Elemental Cults\"><h4 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1273\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using the Elemental Cults</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span title=\"Page 232\">p232</span></span></span></h4> <p>Here are examples of how you can weave <i>Princes of the Apocalypse</i>e<i>Trovão do Rei das Tempestades</i> together by having cultists aid the giants, as a way to hide their own plans:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li\">The Cult of the Black Earth sends cultists to Deadstone Cleft (see chapter 6, \"Canyon of the Stone Giants\"). They provide @UUID[Actor.GcQcxqRbegPcFL9S]{Thane Kayalithica} and her stone giants with information on the defensive capabilities of nearby settlements and offer to help lay waste to them. The cultists might know about the earth primordial trapped under Deadstone Cleft and want to communicate with it.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The Cult of the Eternal Flame helps @UUID[Actor.dEAfcnl04rCFkRQm]{Duke Zalto} and his drow allies (see chapter 8, \"Forge of the Fire Giants\") steal Maegera, the fire primordial trapped in Gauntlgrym. The cultists believe that the fire primordial is the offspring of Imix, the Prince of Evil Fire, whom they worship as a god.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The Cult of the Howling Hatred, after witnessing several cloud giant castles drifting in the skies over the Sword Coast, sends representatives to meet with the cloud giants and learn their intentions. @UUID[Actor.WDyUyhSwWBwZaTiF]{Countess Sansuri} is fascinated by the cult's ability to create devastation orbs and wants a demonstration. Characters who visit her castle (see chapter 9, \"Castle of the Cloud Giants\") might encounter a team of air cultists with a devastation orb in their possession.</li><li class=\"rd__li\">The Cult of the Crushing Wave might help @UUID[Actor.JkP7gg3B5COYQkmu]{Chief Guh} and her hill giants dam the river that runs alongside her den (see chapter 5, \"Den of the Hill Giants\"). Water cultists might also be helping the Kraken Society guard @UUID[Actor.VsnOCFELklLqhp0B]{King Hekaton} (see chapter 11, \"Caught in the Tentacles\").</li></ul></div></div></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"/><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--0\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Out of the Abyss\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1274\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Out of the Abyss</span></h1> <p><i>Out of the Abyss</i> takes place almost entirely in the Underdark, a subterranean expanse of caverns, tunnels, fissures, and lakes. The characters start the adventure as prisoners of the drow and, after escaping their captors, make their way to the surface. If they succeed, they are contacted by King Bruenor Battlehammer of Gauntlgrym and asked to lead an expedition back down into the Underdark, to deal with a terrible demonic threat.</p><p>If you run that adventure as written, the characters are 8th level or thereabouts when they reach Gauntlgrym. You can plan to have them surface when they reach 5th level instead, then segue from <i>Out of the Abyss</i> to <i>Trovão do Rei das Tempestades</i>. Because this adventure takes place in the lands directly above the locations in <i>Out of the Abyss</i>, you can have the characters surface near one of the three locations in chapter 2.</p><p>Once the characters become embroiled in the affairs of giants, you might want to play down the demonic threat in the Underdark. Or you can move back and forth between the two adventures, giving players the option of accepting Bruenor's quest to descend into the Underdark before returning to the surface to deal with the giants. In the latter case, it's likely that the characters will be higher level than normal, but you can make the encounters in this adventure more challenging to compensate (see the \"<a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,3,modifying%20encounter%20difficulty,0\">Modifying Encounter Difficulty</a>\" section in chapter 3 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>).</p></div></div>"
